+=== Logstash 5.2.2 Release Notes
+
+* Fixed an issue where persistent queue feature when enabled on Windows could cause Logstash to crash ({lsissue}6646[Issue 6646]).
+* Fixed an issue where multiple Logstash instances when started with the persistent queue feature and when using the same `path.data` directory 
+  could cause data corruption ({lsissue}6553[Issue 6553]).
+* Fixed an issue where JVM metrics collection was affecting the throughput of Logstash. We were 
+  collecting more information than required from the JVM which has been rectified ({lsissue}6603[Issue 6603]).
