+==== Known issue
+
+Uninstalling a plugin using `bin/logtash-plugin uninstall` may
+result in an error:
+
+```
+Gem::LoadError: You have already activated jruby-openssl 0.12.2, but your Gemfile requires jruby-openssl 0.12.1. Prepending `bundle exec` to your command may solve this.
+```
+
+Logstash should still run, and other plugin operations, such as `update` and `install`, should work as expected.
+
+NOTE: The `bin/logstash-plugin list` command may fail with the same error after a failed uninstallation.
+
+**Resolution**
+
+A successful plugin `update` will resolve this issue, and allow subsequent `uninstall` and `list` operations to
+work without issue.
+
+The `filter-dissect` plugin has recent changes available for update. 
+Running `bin/logstash-plugin update logstash-filter-dissect` should mitigate this issue.
+
+
+==== Logstash core 
+
 No user-facing changes in Logstash core.
