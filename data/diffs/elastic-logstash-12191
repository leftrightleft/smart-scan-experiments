+==== Plugins that prevent automatic reloading
+
+Input and output plugins usually interact with OS resources. In some
+circumstances those resources can't be released without a restart. For this
+reason some plugins can't be simply updated and this prevents pipeline reload.

+reloading for these reasons.
