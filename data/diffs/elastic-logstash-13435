+=== Logstash 7.15.2 Release Notes
+
+[[notable-7-15-2]]
+==== Performance improvements and notable issues fixed
+
+**Jruby-openssl upgrade.** We've upgraded {ls} to 0.11.0 to properly support
+alt-chain certificate verifications in plugins using the Ruby net/http stack.
+The recent Let's Encrypt "DST Root CA X3" expiration has caused issues in
+Logstash plugins such as S3.
+We're including the upstream fix to avoid these issues and support alternate
+chain TLS certificate verification.
