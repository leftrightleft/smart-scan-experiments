+=== Logstash 6.0.1 Release Notes
+* Elasticsearch Output: We now ignore an event's type field for the purpose of setting the document _type if the cluster is Elasticsearch 6.x or above.
+* Fixed bug where plugins that used nested hashes for configuration would not work correctly
+* Improved shutdown process by ensuring that Logstash terminates on second SIGINT. Prior to this release, there were some situations where executing two SIGNINTs would not kill Logstash.
+* Fixed a bug where persistent queue could not be opened when in some states
+* Fixed an issue where the aggregate filter would not always shut down correctly
+* Fixed a large performance regression in the grok filter that has been with us since Logstash 5.x. 
+  Users should see a significant improvement in grok performance.

-==== Issue with Logstash 6.0.0 `document_type` when writing to Elasticsearch 6.x
-
-Weâ€™d like to alert users to behavior in Logstash 6.0.0 that can cause errors when writing to Elasticsearch 6.0+ clusters. When Logstash attempts to index events that result in multiple `type` values, Logstash encounters indexing errors. These errors look similar to the following example, which has been shortened from the full message:
-
-[source,shell]
-----
-[2017-11-21T14:26:01,991][WARN ][logstash.outputs.elasticsearch] Could not index
-event to Elasticsearch.{:status=>400,  :response=>{"error"=>{"reason"=>"Rejecting
-mapping update to [myindex] as the final mapping would have more than 1 type:
-[type1, type2]"}}}}
-----
-
-Users are likely to encounter this error when Logstash is receiving data from:
-
-* multiple types of Beats
-* instances of Filebeat tailing mutliple files with different types
-* multiple Logstash inputs that specify different `type` values
-
-To work around this problem in Logstash 6.0.0, add the setting `document_type => doc` to the Elasticsearch output configuration. We will issue a patch to address this issue soon in a new version of Logstash. 
-
-Logstash has historically used the value of the `type` field to set the Elasticsearch `type` by default. Elasticsearch 6.0 https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/6.0/removal-of-types.html[no longer supports more than one type] per index. This is why the new behavior will only be applied to Elasticsearch 6.0+ clusters with our upcoming fixes.

 ==== Handling Document Types in Elasticsearch 6.0+
 
 As of Elasticsearch 6.0, document types are https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/6.0/removal-of-types.html[on the way out], and only a single mapping type per index is supported. For Logstash users this means transitioning to using the `type` field inside of the document instead of the document type. The effect is the same, but the usage is slightly different. This may mean reconfiguring existing Kibana dashboards to use the new `type` field instead of the document type.
