+## 2.1.2 (Jan 19, 2016)
+### general
+ - Fixed an issue with configtest switch in sysv init script ([#4321](https://github.com/elastic/logstash/pull/4321))
+ - Update jruby-openssl library to 0.9.13
+
+### input
+ - File:
+   - Added config option `close_older` which closes any files that remain unmodified for longer
+     than the specified timespan in seconds ([#44](https://github.com/logstash-plugins/logstash-input-file/issues/81))
+   - Added config option `ignore_older` which monitors if a file that was last modified before
+     the specified timespan in seconds, then its contents are ignored.([#44](https://github.com/logstash-plugins/logstash-input-file/issues/81)) ([#44](https://github.com/logstash-plugins/logstash-input-file/issues/81))
+ - Beats:
+   - Refactored beats input to fix thread synchronization issues under high data volume.([#14](https://github.com/logstash-plugins/logstash-input-beats/issues/14))
+ - Kafka:
+   - Fixed a CPU load issue when no new messages were available in Kafka broker ([#59](https://github.com/logstash-plugins/logstash-input-kafka/issues/59))
+ - http:
+   - Support compressed and gzip POST requests ([#33](https://github.com/logstash-plugins/logstash-input-http/issues/33))  
+
+### filter
+ - Date:
+   - The `timezone` setting now supports sprintf format ([#23](https://github.com/logstash-plugins/logstash-filter-date/issues/23))
+   - New year rollover should be handled better now when a year is not present in the time format.
+     If local time is December, and event time is January, the year will be set to next year. Similar
+     for if local time is January and Event time is December, the year will be set to the previous year.
+     This should help keep times correct in the upcoming year rollover ([#33](https://github.com/logstash-plugins/logstash-filter-date/issues/33))
+
+### output
+ - Elasticsearch:
+   - Added scripted update support ([#235](https://github.com/logstash-plugins/logstash-output-elasticsearch/pull/235))
+   - Changed retry behavior: too busy and service unavailable errors from ES are retried infinitely.
+     Never retry conflict errors ([#321](https://github.com/logstash-plugins/logstash-output-elasticsearch/issues/321))
+ - File:
+   - Added config setting to set dir and file permmission ([#18](https://github.com/logstash-plugins/logstash-output-file/issues/18))
+
+### codec
+  - Multiline: Added `auto_flush` config option, with no default. If not set, no auto_flush is done.
+    This feature flushes events buffered as part of a multiline event when used with
+    file input, for example ([#18](https://github.com/logstash-plugins/logstash-codec-multiline/pull/18)).
