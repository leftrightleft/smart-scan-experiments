+==== Plugins
+
+*Rubydebug Codec*
+
+* Fixes crash that could occur on startup if `$HOME` was unset or if `${HOME}/.aprc` was unreadable by pinning awesome_print dependency to a release before the bug was introduced. https://github.com/logstash-plugins/logstash-codec-rubydebug/pull/5[#5]
+
+*Fingerprint Filter*
+
+* Adds support for non-keyed, regular hash functions. https://github.com/logstash-plugins/logstash-filter-fingerprint/issues/18[#18]
+
+*KV Filter*
+
+* Adds `whitespace => strict` mode, which allows the parser to behave more predictably when input is known to avoid unnecessary whitespace. https://github.com/logstash-plugins/logstash-filter-kv/pull/67[#67]
+* Adds error handling, which tags the event with `_kv_filter_error` if an exception is raised while handling an event instead of allowing the plugin to crash. https://github.com/logstash-plugins/logstash-filter-kv/pull/68[#68]
+
+*Azure Event Hubs Input*
+
+* Initial version of the {logstash-ref}/plugins-inputs-azure_event_hubs.html[azure_event_hubs input plugin], which supersedes logstash-input-azureeventhub.
+
+*Beats Input*
+
+* Adds `add_hostname` flag to enable/disable the population of the `host` field from the beats.hostname. field https://github.com/logstash-plugins/logstash-input-beats/pull/340[#340]
+* Fixes handling of batches where the sequence numbers do not start with 1. https://github.com/logstash-plugins/logstash-input-beats/pull/342[#342]
+* Changes project to use gradle version 4.8.1. https://github.com/logstash-plugins/logstash-input-beats/pull/334[#334]
+* Adds `ssl_peer_metadata` option. https://github.com/logstash-plugins/logstash-input-beats/pull/327[#327]
+* Fixes `ssl_verify_mode => peer`. https://github.com/logstash-plugins/logstash-input-beats/pull/326[#326]
+
+*Exec Input*
+
+* Fixes issue where certain log entries were incorrectly writing 'jdbc input' instead of 'exec input'. https://github.com/logstash-plugins/logstash-input-exec/pull/21[#21]
+
+*File Input*
+
+* Adds new feature: `mode` setting. Introduces two modes, `tail` mode is the existing behaviour for tailing, `read` mode is new behaviour that is optimized for the read complete content scenario. Please read the docs to fully appreciate the benefits of `read` mode.
+* Adds new feature: File completion actions. Settings `file_completed_action` and `file_completed_log_path` control what actions to do after a file is completely read. Applicable: `read` mode only.
+* Adds new feature: in `read` mode, compressed files can be processed, GZIP only.
+* Adds new feature: Files are sorted after being discovered. Settings `file_sort_by` and `file_sort_direction` control the sort order. Applicable: any mode.
+* Adds new feature: Banded or striped file processing. Settings: `file_chunk_size` and `file_chunk_count` control banded or striped processing. Applicable: any mode.
+* Adds new feature: `sincedb_clean_after` setting. Introduces expiry of sincedb records. The default is 14 days. If, after `sincedb_clean_after` days, no activity has been detected on a file (inode) the record expires and is not written to disk. The persisted record now includes the "last activity seen" timestamp. Applicable: any mode.
+* Moves Filewatch code into the plugin folder, rework Filewatch code to use Logstash facilities like logging and environment.
+* Adds much better support for file rotation schemes of copy/truncate and rename cascading. Applies to tail mode only.
+* Adds support for processing files over remote mounts e.g. NFS. Before, it was possible to read into memory allocated but not filled with data resulting in ASCII NUL (0) bytes in the message field. Now, files are read up to the size as given by the remote filesystem client. Applies to tail and read modes.
+* Fixes `read` mode of regular files sincedb write is requested in each read loop iteration rather than waiting for the end-of-file to be reached. Note: for gz files, the sincedb entry can only be updated at the end of the file as it is not possible to seek into a compressed file and begin reading from that position. https://github.com/logstash-plugins/logstash-input-file/pull/196[#196]
+* Adds support for String Durations in some settings e.g. `stat_interval => "750 ms"`. https://github.com/logstash-plugins/logstash-input-file/pull/194[#194]
+* Fixes `require winhelper` error in WINDOWS. https://github.com/logstash-plugins/logstash-input-file/issues/184[#184]
+* Fixes issue, where when no delimiter is found in a chunk, the chunk is reread - no forward progress is made in the file. https://github.com/logstash-plugins/logstash-input-file/issues/185[#185]
+* Fixes JAR_VERSION read problem, prevented Logstash from starting. https://github.com/logstash-plugins/logstash-input-file/issues/180[#180]
+* Fixes sincedb write error when using /dev/null, repeatedly causes a plugin restart. https://github.com/logstash-plugins/logstash-input-file/issues/182[#182]
+* Fixes a regression where files discovered after first discovery were not always read from the beginning. Applies to tail mode only. https://github.com/logstash-plugins/logstash-input-file/issues/198[#198]
+
+
+*Http Input*
+
+* Replaces Puma web server with Netty. https://github.com/logstash-plugins/logstash-input-http/pull/73[#73]
+* Adds `request_headers_target_field` and `remote_host_target_field` configuration options with default to host and headers respectively. https://github.com/logstash-plugins/logstash-input-http/pull/68[#68]
+* Sanitizes content-type header with getMimeType. https://github.com/logstash-plugins/logstash-input-http/pull/87[#87]
+* Moves most message handling code to Java. https://github.com/logstash-plugins/logstash-input-http/pull/85[#85]
+* Fixes issue to respond with correct http protocol version. https://github.com/logstash-plugins/logstash-input-http/pull/84[#84]
+* Adds support for crt/key certificates.
+* Deprecates jks support.
+
+*Jdbc Input*
+
+* Fixes crash that occurs when receiving string input that cannot be coerced to UTF-8 (such as BLOB data). https://github.com/logstash-plugins/logstash-input-jdbc/pull/291[#291]
+
+*S3 Input*
+
+* Adds ability to optionally include S3 object properties inside `@metadata`. https://github.com/logstash-plugins/logstash-input-s3/pull/155[#155]
+
+*Kafka Output*
+
+* Fixes handling of two settings that weren't wired to the kafka client. https://github.com/logstash-plugins/logstash-output-kafka/pull/198[#198]
+
