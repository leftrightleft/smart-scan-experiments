 === Logstash 6.4.0 Release Notes
 
+[IMPORTANT]
+--
+**Attention users of Kafka Output in Logstash 6.4.0**
+
+If you are using Kafka output and have upgraded to Logstash 6.4.0, you will see pipeline startup errors:
+
+    Pipeline aborted due to error {:pipeline_id=>"pipeline1", :exception=>org.apache.kafka.common.config.ConfigException: Invalid value 32768 for configuration receive.buffer.bytes: Expected value to be a 32-bit integer, but it was a java.lang.Long 
+
+This error was due to an incorrectly configured default value for the
+`receive_buffer_bytes` option (fixed in PR
+https://github.com/logstash-plugins/logstash-output-kafka/pull/205[logstash-output-kafka #205]),
+and false negative results on our CI due to incorrect exit code
+handling (fixed in
+https://github.com/logstash-plugins/logstash-output-kafka/pull/204[logstash-output-kafka#204]).
+
+Kafka output plugin version 7.1.3 has been released. You can upgrade
+using:
+
+[source,sh]
+-----
+bin/logstash-plugin update logstash-output-kafka
+-----
+
+This version will be included in the next 6.4.1 patch release.
