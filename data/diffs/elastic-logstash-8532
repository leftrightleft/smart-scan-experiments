 If you are installing Logstash with other components in the Elastic Stack, also see the
 {stack-ref}/index.html[Elastic Stack installation and upgrade documentation].
 
+If you are using the default mapping templates in Logstash, to continue using these after migrating Elasticsearch to 6.0, you must override the existing template with the 6.x template.
+ This can be done by starting a pipeline with the `overwrite_template => true` option in the Elasticsearch output definition in the Logstash config.
+
+Note that multiple doctypes are no longer supported in Elasticsearch 6.0. Please refer to

 ==== When to Upgrade
 
 Fresh installations can and should start with the same version across the Elastic Stack.

-Although we make great efforts to ensure compatibility, Logstash 5.0 is not completely backwards compatible. As noted
