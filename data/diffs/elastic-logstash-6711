 The version numbers were found by checking the compatibility matrix for the individual plugins.
 
-Specifically, for the Kafka input plugin, configs have changed a lot. Configuration `topic_id` 
-is replaced by `topics`. `zk_connect` is replaced by `bootstrap_servers` which are Kafka brokers. `consumer_id` is 
-replaced by `client_id`. Also, offsets are now stored in Kafka topics instead of Zookeeper. See <<plugins-inputs-kafka>>

+==== Kafka Input Configuration Changes
+
+As described in the section <<plugin-versions, above>>, the Kafka plugin has been updated to bring in new consumer features. 
+In addition, to the plugin being incompatible with 0.8.x version of the Kafka broker, _most_ of the config options have 
+been changed to match the new consumer configurations from the Kafka Java consumer. Here's a list of important config options that have changed:
+
+* `topic_id` is renamed to `topics` and accepts an array of topics to consume from.
+* `zk_connect` has been dropped; you should use `bootstrap_servers`. There is no need for the consumer to go through ZooKeeper.
+* `consumer_id` is renamed to `client_id`.
+
+We recommend users of the Kafka plugin to check the documentation for the latest <<plugins-inputs-kafka, config options>>.
