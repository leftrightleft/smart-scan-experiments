+==== Elasticsearch output changes
+
+* The default `document_type` has changed from `logs` to `doc` for consistency with Beats.
+  Furthermore, users are advised that Elasticsearch 6.0 deprecates doctypes, and 7.0 will remove them. 
+  See https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/master/removal-of-types.html[Removal of Mapping Types] for more info.
+* The options `flush_size` and `idle_flush_time` are now obsolete.
+* Please note that the https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/6.0/mapping-all-field.html[_all] field is deprecated in 6.0.
+ The new mapping template has been updated to reflect that. If you are using a custom mapping template you may need to update it to reflect that.

+==== Kafka input changes
+
+* Upgraded Kafka client support to v0.11.0.0, which only supports Kafka brokers v0.10.x or later.
