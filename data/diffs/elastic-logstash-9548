-== Breaking Changes Across PQ Versions
+== Breaking Changes Across PQ Versions Prior to Logstash 6.3.0
 
-We regret to say that due to several serialization issues users will have to take some extra steps when upgrading Logstash instances using persistent queues. While we do strive to maintain backward compatibility within a given major release these bugs have forced us to break that compatibility to ensure correctness of operation. For more technical details on this issue please check our tracking github issue for this matter, https://github.com/elastic/logstash/issues/9494[#9494].
+The following applies only to users upgrading from Logstash installations that used the persistent queue prior to 6.3.0.
 
-If you are upgrading Logstash and use the persistent queue, we strongly recommend that you drain or delete the persistent queue before you upgrade.
