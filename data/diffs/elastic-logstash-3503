-The main themes of this release are improved plugin management, increased
-performance, and Apache Kafka integration (see more details in the Logstash 1.5
-beta1 announcement). We are currently working to incorporate community feedback

-== Plugin Framework
-[float]
-=== status: ongoing; v1.5
-
-Logstash has a rich collection of 165+ plugins, which are developed by
-Elasticsearch and contributed by the community. Previously, most commonly-used
-plugins were bundled with Logstash to make the getting started experience
-easier. However, there was no way to update plugins outside of the Logstash
-release cycle. In Logstash 1.5, we created a powerful plugin framework based on
-https://rubygems.org/[RubyGems.org] to facilitate per-plugin installation and
-updates. We will continue to distribute commonly-used plugins with Logstash, but
-now users will be able to install new plugins and receive plugin updates at any
-time. Read more about these changes in the

-== Performance

-=== status: ongoing; v1.5, v2.x
-
-In the 1.5 release, we significantly improved the performance of the Grok
-filter, which is used to parse text via regular expressions. Based on our
-internal benchmarks, parsing common log formats, such as Apache logs, was 2x
-faster in Logstash 1.5 compared to previous versions. We also sped up JSON
-serialization and deserialization. In future releases of Logstash, we plan to
-incorporate additional JRuby optimizations to make the code even more efficient.
-We also plan to seek community feedback in terms of prioritizing other aspects
-of performance, such as startup time, resource utilization, and pipeline
-latency.
