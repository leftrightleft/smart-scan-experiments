+Monitoring {ls} with legacy internal collection uses these components:

+* <<logstash-monitoring-output,Output>>
+
+These pieces live outside of the default Logstash pipeline in a dedicated monitoring
+pipeline. This configuration ensures that all data and processing has a minimal
+impact on ordinary Logstash processing. Existing Logstash features, such as the
+<<plugins-outputs-elasticsearch,`elasticsearch` output>>, can be reused to

+configured by using anything from the Logstash configurations that might also be 
+using their own separate `elasticsearch` outputs.
+
+The {es} cluster that is configured for use with {monitoring} for Logstash is 
+expected to be the production cluster. This configuration enables the production 
+{es} cluster to add metadata (for example, its cluster UUID) to the Logstash
+monitoring data then route it to the monitoring clusters. For more information
