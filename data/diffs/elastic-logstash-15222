+=== Logstash 8.9.0 Release Notes
+
+[[notable-8.9.0]]
+==== Notable issues fixed
+
+* Fixed an https://github.com/elastic/logstash/issues/15130[issue] where installs and updates of certain {ls} plugins could fail when located behind a proxy https://github.com/elastic/logstash/pull/15131[#15131]. 
+This issue surfaced after `logstash-filter-translate` was updated to require that the `jar-dependencies` gem be used to retrieve artifacts from maven when the plugin was installed. 
+This requirement could prevent the plugin update when a proxy was in use.
+* Improved logging when {ls} is stalled on shutdown https://github.com/elastic/logstash/pull/15056[#15056]. 
+We now provide additional information about the main thread if it is causing the shutdown to stall.
+* Improved SSL settings for connection to {es} for central management and monitoring https://github.com/elastic/logstash/pull/15045[#15045]. 
+This commit adds settings support for file-based certificates and cipher suites for management and monitoring settings, and removes the deprecation warnings from the logs that have been in since SSL configuration settings were revamped in the {es} output.
