 Be sure to replace or delete `logstash.conf` in your custom image, so
 that you don't retain the example config from the base image.
 
+==== Environment variable configuration
+
+Under Docker, Logstash settings can be configured via environment
+variables. When the container starts, a helper process checks the environment
+for variables that can be mapped to Logstash settings. Settings that are found
+in the environment are merged into `logstash.yml` as the container starts up.
+
+For compatibility with container orchestration systems, these environment
+variables are written in all capitals, with underscores as word
+separators

+**Environment Variable**:: **Logstash Setting**
+`PIPELINE_WORKERS`:: `pipeline.workers`
+`LOG_LEVEL`:: `log.level`
+`XPACK_MONITORING_ENABLED`:: `xpack.monitoring.enabled`
+
+In general, any setting listed in the <<logstash-settings-file, settings
+documentation>> can be configured with this technique.
+
+NOTE: Defining settings with environment variables causes `logstash.yml` to
+be modified in place. This behaviour is likely undesirable if `logstash.yml` was
+bind-mounted from the host system. Thus, it is not reccomended to
+combine the bind-mount technique with the environment variable technique. It
+is best to choose a single method for defining Logstash settings.

 Under Docker, Logstash logs go to standard output by default. To
