-== Breaking Changes
+
+== Breaking Changes Across PQ Versions
+
+If you are upgrading Logstash and use the persistent queue, we strongly recommend that you drain or delete the persistent queue before you upgrade.
+
+To drain the queue, enable the `queue.drain` setting, and then shutdown Logstash. Wait for it to shutdown completely. This may take a while if you have a large queue backlog.
+
+We are working to resolve issues with data incompatibilities in our 6.3.0 release. These steps wonâ€™t be required when you upgrade to versions greater than or equal to 6.3.0.
+
+== Breaking Changes in 6.0.0
 
 This section discusses the changes that you need to be aware of when migrating to Logstash 6.0.0 from the previous major releases.
