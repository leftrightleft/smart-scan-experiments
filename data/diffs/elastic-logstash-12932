+=== Logstash 7.13.0 Release Notes
+
+[[featured-7-13-0]]
+==== New features and enhancements
+
+===== Progress toward Elastic Common Schema (ECS)
+In this release, we've made more Logstash plugins compatible with the Elastic Common Schema (ECS). This release builds on ECS work in previous releases, and adds ECS-compatibility for these plugins:
+
+* {logstash-ref}/plugins-inputs-file.html[File input]
+* {logstash-ref}/plugins-inputs-stdin.html[Stdin input] 
+* {logstash-ref}/plugins-inputs-syslog.html[Syslog input] 
+* {logstash-ref}/plugins-codecs-cef.html[Cef codec] 
+* {logstash-ref}/plugins-filters-clone.html[Clone filter]
+* {logstash-ref}/plugins-filters-geoip.html[Geoip filter] 
+* {logstash-ref}/plugins-filters-syslog_pri.html[Syslog_pri filter] 
+* {logstash-ref}/plugins-filters-tld.html[Tld filter] 
+
+ECS compatibility is off-by-default in Logstash 7.x, but will be on-by-default in Logstash 8.0.
+
+===== Elasticsearch datastreams
+The {logstash-ref}/plugins-outputs-elasticsearch.html[Elasticsearch output plugin] now supports {ref}/data-streams.html[Elasticsearch data streams]. 
+You can use the plugin to send time series datasets (such as logs, events, and metrics) as well as non-time series data to Elasticsearch.
+
+Elasticsearch data streams store append-only time series data across multiple indices while giving you a single named resource for requests. Data streams are well-suited for logs, events, metrics, and other continuously generated data.
+
+The Elasticsearch output offers {logstash-ref}/plugins-outputs-elasticsearch.html#plugins-outputs-elasticsearch-data-streams[data stream options] that are designed for indexing time series datasets into Elasticsearch.
+
