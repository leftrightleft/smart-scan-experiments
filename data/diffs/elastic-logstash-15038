+=== Logstash 8.8.0 Release Notes
+
+[[notable-8.8.0]]
+==== Notable issues fixed
+
+* Fix a race condition that prevents Logstash from updating a pipeline's configuration with in-flight events
+  experiencing connection errors. https://github.com/elastic/logstash/issues/14739[#14739]
+  This issue primarily manifests following the update of Elasticsearch credentials through Central Management,
+  after credentials expired while events were in-flight. It causes the Elasticsearch Output to get stuck attempting
+  to send events with the expired credentials instead of using the updated ones.
+  To address this problem, Logstash has improved the pipeline shutdown phase functionality to allow an output plugin
+  to request the termination of the in-flight batch of events; hence preventing the need for administrators
+  to manually restart Logstash. Furthermore, when used in combination with a persistent queue to prevent data loss,
+  the batch is eligible for reprocessing on pipeline restart.
+  Plugin developers can now decide whether to make use of such functionality on output plugins. https://github.com/elastic/logstash/pull/14940[#14940]
