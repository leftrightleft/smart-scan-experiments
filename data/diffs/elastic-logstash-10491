+[[right-option]]
+=== Is {ls} the right ingest option?
+
+The Elastic Stack offers options for ingesting data into {es}.
+Is {ls} the right ingest option for _your_ particular use case?
+
+Here are your ingest options:
+
+* <<fb-ingest,{Filebeat}>>
+* <<ingest-node,{es} ingest nodes>>
+* <<ls-ingest,{ls}>>
+* <<combi-ingest, A combination>>
+
+{ls} is powerful. It's more powerful (and potentially more complex) than
+required for many use cases. Or, Logstash might be just what you need.
+Here's more information to help you decide.
+
+[float]
+[[fb-ingest]]
+==== {Filebeat} for ingest
+
+Beats are lightweight data shippers that you install as agents on your servers.
+Filebeat is a great tool for tailing files, and it comes with 
+{filebeat-ref}/filebeat-modules.html[more than 20 modules] to get you up and running
+quickly. Filebeat modules can ingest data in a wide range of common log formats
+(such as Apache, Elasticsearch, Kafka, and MongoDB) with minimal configuration.
+They also come with sample dashboards, index templates, and, in some cases,
+machine learning jobs.
+
+The {filebeat-ref}/filebeat-modules.html[list of modules] keeps growing, so check it out
+to see if a module is the right solution for you.
+
+If the data you want to ingest is not covered by these modules, Logstash and Elasticsearch
+ingest nodes provide a flexible and powerful way to parse and process most types
+of text-based data. 
+
+[float]
+[[ingest-node]]
+==== Elasticsearch ingest nodes for ingest
+
+You can use {ref}/ingest.html[Elasticsearch ingest nodes] to process documents in Elasticsearch prior to
+indexing. They allow simple architectures with minimum components, where
+applications send data directly to Elasticsearch for processing and indexing.
+This often simplifies getting started with the Elastic Stack, and also
+scales out as data volumes grow. 
+
+Ingest nodes duplicates some but not all functionality that Logstash offers.
+
+[float]
+[[ls-ingest]]
+==== Logstash for ingest  
+
+{ls} uses plugins to offer a wide variety of inputs, filters, and outputs for
+collecting, enriching, and transforming data.
+
+{ls} is the best choice when you need to:
+
+* send to multiple outputs
+* "read in" data
+* enrich your data
+* modify your data using grok or dissect
+* strip information from your data before forwarding (removing `location` for GDPR compliance, for example)
+* use queueing
+
+If you are still trying to decide if {es} ingest node or {ls} is your best option,
+check out this article: 
+https://www.elastic.co/blog/should-i-use-logstash-or-elasticsearch-ingest-nodes[Should I use Logstash or Elasticsearch ingest nodes?]
+
+[float]
+[[combi-ingest]]
+==== Combination of ingest options
+
+A combination of ingest options may be the right approach for your use case.
+In fact, Filebeat modules use ingest nodes for processing.
+
+Other examples include {filebeat} to {ls} (see Filebeat's 
+{filebeat-ref}/filebeat-module-logstash.html)[Logstash module]), and
+{filebeat} to ingest node (see
+{filebeat-ref}/configuring-ingest-node.html)[Parse data using ingest node] in
+the {filebeat} Reference).
