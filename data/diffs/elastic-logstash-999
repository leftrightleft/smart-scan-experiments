+# A simple output which prints to the STDOUT of the shell running
+# Logstash. This output can be quite convenient when debugging
+# plugin configurations, by allowing instant access to the event
+# data after it has passed through the inputs and filters.
+#
+# For example, the following output configuration, in conjunction with the
+# Logstash `-e` command-line flag, will allow you to see the results
+# of your event pipeline for quick iteration. 
+# 
+#     output {
+#       stdout {}
+#     }
+# 
+# Useful codecs include:
+#
+# `rubydebug`: outputs event data using the ruby "awesome_print"
+# library[http://rubygems.org/gems/awesome_print]
+#
+#     output {
+#       stdout { codec => rubydebug }
+#     }
+#
+# `json`: outputs event data in structured JSON format
+#
+#     output {
+#       stdout { codec => json }
+#     }
