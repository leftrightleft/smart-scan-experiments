+## Building Logstash Documentation
+
+To build the Logstash Reference (open source content only) on your local
+machine, clone the following repos:
+
+[logstash](https://github.com/elastic/logstash) - contains main docs about core features
+
+[logstash-docs](https://github.com/elastic/logstash-docs) - contains generated plugin docs
+
+[docs](https://github.com/elastic/docs) - contains doc build files
+
+Make sure you have the same branch checked out in `logstash` and `logstash-docs`.
+Check out `master` in the `docs` repo.
+
+Run the doc build script from within the `docs` repo. For example:
+
+```
+./build_docs.pl --doc ../logstash/docs/index.asciidoc --chunk=1 -open
+```
+
