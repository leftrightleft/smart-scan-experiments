+[[stalled-shutdown]]
+=== Stalled Shutdown Detection
+
+Shutting down a running Logstash instance involves the following steps:
+
+* Stop all input, filter and output plugins
+* Process all in-flight events
+* Terminate the Logstash process
+
+The following conditions affect the shutdown process:
+
+* An input plugin receiving data at a slow pace.
+* A slow filter, like a Ruby filter executing `sleep(10000)` or an Elasticsearch filter that is executing a very heavy 
+query.
+* A disconnected output plugin that is waiting to reconnect to flush in-flight events.
+
+These situations make the duration and success of the shutdown process unpredictable.
+
+Logstash has a stall detection mechanism that analyzes the behavior of the pipeline and plugins during shutdown.
+This mechanism produces periodic information about the count of inflight events in internal queues and a list of busy 
+worker threads.
+
+To enable Logstash to forcibly terminate in the case of a stalled shutdown, use the `--allow-unsafe-shutdown` flag when 
+you start Logstash.
+
+[[shutdown-stall-example]]
+==== Stall Detection Example
+
+In this example, slow filter execution prevents the pipeline from clean shutdown. By starting Logstash with the
+`--allow-unsafe-shutdown` flag, quitting with *Ctrl+C* results in an eventual shutdown that loses 20 events.
+
+========
+[source,shell]
+% bin/logstash -e 'input { generator { } } filter { ruby { code => "sleep 10000" } } \

+When `--allow-unsafe-shutdown` isn't enabled, Logstash continues to run and produce these reports periodically.
