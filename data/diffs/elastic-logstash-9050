 sensitive settings.

 === Keystore password
 
-Access to the Logstash keystore can be protected by a password. The keystore password must be stored in the environment variable `LOGSTASH_KEYSTORE_PASS`. If the Logstash keystore is created with this environment variable set, then the environment variable needs to be accessible to the running instance of Logstash. Also any keystore commands (add, list, remove, etc.) require the environment entry defined for the user performing the commands.
+You can protect access to the Logstash keystore by storing a password in an
+environment variable called `LOGSTASH_KEYSTORE_PASS`. If you create the Logstash
+keystore after setting this variable, the keystore will be password protected.
+This means that the environment variable needs to be accessible to the running
+instance of Logstash. This environment variable must also be correctly set for
+any users who need to issue keystore commands (add, list, remove, etc.).
 
-Using the keystore password is optional, and if not set the data is still encrypted. However, it is highly recommended to configure the keystore password and ensure restrictive
-permissions to any files that may contain the environment variable value.
