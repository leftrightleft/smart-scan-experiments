+On some Linux systems, you may also need to have the `JAVA_HOME` environment 
+exported before attempting the install, particularly if you installed Java 
+from a tarball.  This is because Logstash uses Java during installation to 
+automatically detect your environment and install the correct startup method 
+(SysV init scripts, Upstart, or systemd).  If Logstash is unable to find the 
+JAVA_HOME environment variable during package installation time, you may get 
+an error message, and Logstash will be unable to start properly.
