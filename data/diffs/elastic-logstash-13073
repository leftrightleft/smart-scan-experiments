+[[ts-schema-registry]]
+===== Kafka input plugin crashes when using schema registry
+
+By default, the kafka input plugin checks connectivity and validates the schema registry during plugin registration before events are processed. 
+In some circumstances, this process may fail when it tries to validate an authenticated schema registry, causing the plugin to crash.
+
+The plugin offers a `schema_registry_validation` setting to change the default behavior. 
+This setting allows the plugin to skip validation during registration, which allows the plugin to continue and events to be processed. 
+See the <<plugins-inputs-kafka-schema_registry_validation,kafka input plugin documentation>> for more information about the plugin and other configuration options. 
+
+NOTE: An incorrectly configured schema registry will still stop the plugin from processing events.
+
+NOTE: The default setting of `auto` is the best option for most circumstances and should not need to be changed.
