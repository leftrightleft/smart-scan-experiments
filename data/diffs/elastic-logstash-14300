+* {ls} is more efficient at fetching pipelines as of 8.3.0. 
 When a {ls} instance sends its pipeline IDs to {es} or central pipeline management in {kib}, it gets back only the pipeline configs that belong to that instance. 
 These enhancements required changes to both {ls} https://github.com/elastic/logstash/pull/14076[(#14076)] and {es} https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/pull/85847[(#85847)].
 + 
 These improvements dramatically decrease network load while also giving users the ability to control pipelines dynamically using wildcards.
 
+* Dead Letter Queues can now be configured to drop older events instead of new ones when they're full. The setting "dead_letter_queue.storage_policy" has been introduced for this purpose, and new metrics - such as a counter for dropped events - are now exposed in the API to better monitor the DLQ behavior. https://github.com/elastic/logstash/pull/13923[#13923] https://github.com/elastic/logstash/pull/14058[#14058]
+
+* To improve security of Logstash deployments, 8.3.0 brings a new setting "allow_superuser" that defaults to false. When enabled it prevents Logstash from starting as super user ("root"). This setting will be enabled by default in the future. Consider explicitly enabling it. Otherwise a deprecation log entry will be emitted. https://github.com/elastic/logstash/pull/14046[#14046] https://github.com/elastic/logstash/pull/14089[#14089]
+
+* Continuing with the focus on security, we've introduced "api.auth.basic.password_policy.mode" to ensure the password used to guard Logstash's HTTP API has a minimum set of strength requirements. By default a warning will be emitted if the defined password doesn't meet the criteria, but in a future release the mode will be set to "ERROR". https://github.com/elastic/logstash/pull/14045[#14045] https://github.com/elastic/logstash/pull/14105[#14105] https://github.com/elastic/logstash/pull/14159[#14159]
+
+* Elasticsearch introduced "security on by default" back in 8.0.0, with TLS enabled by default in its HTTP and transport layers. To facilitate connecting to 8.x clusters, Elasticsearch displays the fingerprint of the Certificate Authority it generates on startup. This release of Logstash introduces support for setting "ca_trusted_fingerprint" in Elasticsearch input, filter and outputs plugins. https://github.com/elastic/logstash/pull/14120[#14120]
+
+* Technical Preview: Receiving events containing keys with characters that have special meaning to Logstash such as `[` and `]` (for field references) has always causes issues to data ingestion. A new setting in Technical Preview, disabled by default, called "config.field_reference.escape_style" was introduced to handle such special characters by escaping them. https://github.com/elastic/logstash/pull/14044[#14044]
+
+[[notable-8.3.0]]
+==== Notable issues fixed
+
+* Don't display values of password type settings in conditionals https://github.com/elastic/logstash/pull/13997[#13997]
+* Introduce a retry mechanism in pipeline-to-pipeline instead of crashing https://github.com/elastic/logstash/pull/14027[#14027]
+* Add thread safety around Puma startup/shutdown https://github.com/elastic/logstash/pull/14080[#14080]
+* Add value converters for java.time classes https://github.com/elastic/logstash/pull/13972[#13972]
+* Correct the class reference to the MetricNotFound exception https://github.com/elastic/logstash/pull/13970[#13970]
+* Fix a possible corruption of Persistent Queue during a crash of the Logstash process https://github.com/elastic/logstash/pull/14165[#14165]
+
+[[dependencies-8.3.0]]
