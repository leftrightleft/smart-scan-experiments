+## 1.5.3 (July 21, 2015)
+### general
+  - Added back `--pluginpath` command line option to `bin/logstash`. This loads plugin source code
+    files from given file location (#3580).
+  - Improved default security configuration for SSL (#3579).
+  - For debian and rpm packages added ability to force stop Logstash. This can be enabled by setting
+    the environment variable `KILL_ON_STOP_TIMEOUT=1` before stopping. If the Logstash process
+    has not stopped within a reasonable time, this will force it to shutdown. 
+    **Note**: Please be aware that you could lose inflight messages if you force stop
+    Logstash (#3578).
+  - Added a periodic report of inflight events during shutdown. This provides feedback to users
+    about events being processed while shutdown is being handled (#3484).
+  - Added ability to install and use pre-released plugins (beta and RC versions)
+  - Fixed a permission issue in the init script for Debian and RPM packages. While running as 
+    logstash user it was not possible to access files owned by supplemental groups (#1449).
+
+### codec
+  - Added support to handle JSON data with root arrays. Array entries will be split into
+    individual events (#12).
