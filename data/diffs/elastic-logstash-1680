 #
 # Files are followed in a manner similar to "tail -0F". File rotation
 # is detected and handled by this input.
+#
+# On Linux systems files are tracked using the inode number. If the inode
+# number changes this filter will think a new file has appeared and read it.
+# This can happen if programs update files by writing a new file, deleting
+# the old and then renaming. It can also happen if the underlying filesystem
+# cannot provide stable inodes (e.g. mounted NTFS volumes). In these cases,
+# one option is to use `rsync --inplace --no-W` to syncronize the files to 
+# standard Linux filesystem and read the files from there. You can view a file's
+# inode with `ls -i`.
