+=== Logstash 6.2.4 Release Notes
+
+* Fixed an issue where events passing through the persistent queue had the contents of string type fields corrupted for values containing non-ASCII characters. The solution involved serializing the RubyString as Java String UTF-16 encoded https://github.com/elastic/logstash/pull/9167[#9167]
+* Fixed serialization bug when a RubyString that comes out of a matching, substring or similar operation may not have offset 0 pointing at the underlying BytesList. Solved by serializing the correct part of the BytesList https://github.com/elastic/logstash/pull/9308[#9308]
+* Improved performance of Event#cancel, where each operation would unnecessarily generate a new object. In configurations that use plugins like the `drop filter` throughput may increase up to 5x https://github.com/elastic/logstash/pull/9284[#9284]
+* Fixed an issue with type handling in metadata fields. Before this a plugin could trigger a Java exception when placing data into an event's metadata https://github.com/elastic/logstash/pull/9299[#9299]
+* Fixed a race condition in shutdown of pipelines where not all workers would consume a single SHUTDOWN signal https://github.com/elastic/logstash/pull/9285[#9285]
+* Multiple documentation improvements relating to configuration files, JVM options, default plugin codecs, Logstash-to-Logstash communication and Keystore.
+
+==== Plugins
+
+*Json_lines Codec*
+
+* Support flush method, see https://github.com/logstash-plugins/logstash-codec-json_lines/pull/35
+
+*Netflow Codec*
+
+* Workaround for breaking change in Netflow-Input-UDP > 3.2.0, see issue https://github.com/logstash-plugins/logstash-codec-netflow/issues/122[#122]
+* Renamed some unknown VMware VDS fields
+
+*Aggregate Filter*
+
+* new feature: add 'timeout_timestamp_field' option.
+  When set, this option computes timeout based on event timestamp field (and not system time). It's particularly useful when processing old logs.
+* new feature: add 'inactivity_timeout' option.
+  Events for a given `task_id` will be aggregated for as long as they keep arriving within the defined `inactivity_timeout` option - the inactivity timeout is reset each time a new event happens. On the contrary, `timeout` is never reset and happens after `timeout` seconds since aggregation map creation.
+
