 * The `pipeline.batch.size` setting defines the maximum number of events an individual worker thread collects before attempting to execute filters and outputs. Larger batch sizes are generally more efficient, but increase memory overhead. Some hardware configurations require you to increase JVM heap space in the `jvm.options` config file to avoid performance degradation. (See <<config-setting-files>> for more info.) Values in excess of the optimum range cause performance degradation due to frequent garbage collection or JVM crashes related to out-of-memory exceptions. Output plugins can process each batch as a logical unit. The Elasticsearch output, for example, issues https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/docs-bulk.html[bulk requests] for each batch received. Tuning the `pipeline.batch.size` setting adjusts the size of bulk requests sent to Elasticsearch.
 
-* The `pipeline.batch.delay` setting rarely needs to be tuned. This setting adjusts the latency of the Logstash pipeline. Pipeline batch delay is the maximum amount of time in milliseconds that Logstash waits for new messages after receiving an event in the current pipeline worker thread. After this time elapses, Logstash begins to execute filters and outputs.The maximum time that Logstash waits between receiving an event and processing that event in a filter is the product of the `pipeline.batch.delay` and  `pipeline.batch.size` settings.
