+In this architecture, each output has its own queue with its own tuning and settings. Note that this approach uses up to twice as much disk space and incurs three times as much serialization/deserialization cost as a single pipeline.
 
 If any of the persistent queues of the downstream pipelines (in the example above, `buffered-es` and `buffered-http`) become full, both outputs will stop.
