+=== Environment Variables
+Logstash startup script uses environment variables so you can easily configure your
+environment if you wish to do so.
+
+When you start Logstash using the startup script, we launch Java with pre-configured JVM options. 
+Most times it is better to leave the options as is, but you have the option to pass in
+extra JVM settings. For example, if you want to monitor Logstash using JMX, you can add these settings
+using the environment variable `LS_JAVA_OPTS` and start Logstash
+
+In some cases, you may want to completely override the default JVM options chosen by Logstash and use
+your own settings. Setting `JAVA_OPTS` before you start Logstash will ignore the defaults in the scripts
