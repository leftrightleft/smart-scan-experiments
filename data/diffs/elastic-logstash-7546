+=== Upgrading with Persistent Queues Enabled
+
+Upgrading Logstash with persistent queues enabled is supported. The persistent
+queue directory is self-contained and can be read by a new Logstash instance
+running the same pipeline. You can safely shut down the original Logstash
+instance, spin up a new instance, and set `path.queue` in the `logstash.yml`
+<<logstash-settings-file,settings file>> to point to the original queue directory.
+You can also use a mounted drive to make this workflow easier.
+
+Keep in mind that only one Logstash instance can write to `path.queue`. You
+cannot have the original instance and the new instance writing to the queue at
+the same time.
