-The dead letter queue (DLQ) can provide another layer of data resilience. 
+The dead letter queue (DLQ) is designed as a place to temporarily write events that cannot be processed. 
+The DLQ gives you flexibility to investigate problematic events without blocking the pipeline or losing the events. 
+Your pipeline keeps flowing, and the immediate problem is averted.
+But those events still need to be addressed.  
+
+You can <<es-proc-dlq,process events from the DLQ>> with the <<plugins-inputs-dead_letter_queue,`dead_letter_queue` input plugin>> .
+
+Processing events does not delete items from the queue, and the DLQ sometimes needs attention.
+See <<dlq-size>> and <<dlq-clear>> for more info.
