+=== Pipeline Viewer UI
+
+NOTE: The pipeline viewer is an {xpack} feature that requires a
+paid {xpack} license. See the
+https://www.elastic.co/subscriptions[Elastic Subscriptions] page for
+information about obtaining a license.
+
+The pipeline viewer in {xpack} provides a simple way for you to visualize and
+monitor the behavior of complex Logstash pipeline configurations. Within the
+pipeline viewer, you can explore a directed acyclic graph (DAG) representation
+of the overall pipeline topology, data flow, and branching logic. The diagram
+is overlayed with important metrics, like events per second and time spent in
+milliseconds, for each plugin in the view.
+
+The diagram includes visual indicators to draw your attention to potential
+bottlenecks in the pipeline, making it easy for you to diagnose and fix
+problems.
+
+[IMPORTANT]
+==========================================================================
+When you configure the stages in your Logstash pipeline, make sure you specify
+semantic IDs. If you don't specify IDs, Logstash generates them for you.
+
+Using semantic IDs makes it easier to identify the configurations that are
+causing bottlenecks. For example, you may have several grok filters running
+in your pipeline. If you haven't specified semantic IDs, you won't be able
+to tell at a glance which filters are slow. If you specify semantic IDs,
+such as `apacheParsingGrok` and `cloudwatchGrok`, you'll know exactly which
+grok filters are causing bottlenecks.
+
+==========================================================================
+
+Before using the pipeline viewer, you need to
+{logstash-ref}/setup-xpack.html[set up {xpack}] and configure
+{xpack-ref}/monitoring-logstash.html[Logstash monitoring].

+==== View the pipeline diagram
+
+To view the pipeline diagram:
+
+. In Logstash, start the Logstash pipeline that you want to monitor.
++
+Assuming that you've set up Logstash monitoring, Logstash will begin shipping
+metrics to the monitoring cluster.
+
+. Navigate to the Monitoring tab in Kibana.
++
+You should see a Logstash section. 
++
+image::static/docs/images/monitoring-ui.png[Monitoring UI]
+
+. Click the *Pipelines* link under Logstash to see all the pipelines that are
+being monitored.
++
+Each pipeline is identified by a pipeline ID (`main` by default). For each
+pipeline, you'll see a list of all versions of the pipeline stats that were
+captured during the specified time range.
++
+image::static/docs/images/pipeline-viewer-overview.png[Pipeline Overview]
++
+The version information is auto-generated by Logstash. Each time you modify a
+pipeline, Logstash generates a new version hash. Viewing different versions
+of the pipeline stats allows you see how changes to the pipeline over time
+affect throughput and other metrics. Note that Logstash stores multiple versions
+of the pipeline stats; it does not store multiple versions of the pipeline
+configurations themselves.
+
+. Click a pipeline version in the list to drill down and explore the pipeline
+diagram.
++
+The diagram shows all the stages feeding data through the pipeline. It also shows
+conditional logic.
++
+image::static/docs/images/pipeline-diagram.png[Pipeline Diagram]
++
+The information displayed on each node varies depending on the plugin type.
++
+Here's an example of an *input* node:
++
+image::static/docs/images/pipeline-input-detail.png[Input node]
++
+The *I* badge indicates that this is an input stage. The node shows:
++
+--
+* input type - *stdin*
+* user-supplied ID - *logfileRead*
+* throughput expressed in events per second - *0.7 e/s*
+
+Here's an example of a *filter* node.
+
+image::static/docs/images/pipeline-filter-detail.png[Filter node]
+
+The filter icon indicates that this is a filter stage. The node shows:
+
+* filter type - *sleep*
+* user-supplied ID - *caSleep*
+* worker usage expressed as the percentage of total execution time - *0%*
+* performance - the number of milliseconds spent processing each event - *20.00 ms/e*
+* throughput - the number of events sent per second - *0.0 e/s*
+
+Stats that are anomalously slow appear highlighted in the pipeline viewer.
+This doesn't necessarily indicate a problem, but it highlights potential
+bottle necks so that you can find them quickly.
+
+An *output* node shows the same information as a filter node, but it has an
+*O* badge to indicate that it is an output stage:
+
+image::static/docs/images/pipeline-output-detail.png[Output node]
+--
+
+. Hover over a node in the diagram, and you'll see only the related nodes that
+are ancestors or descendants of the current node. 
+
+. Explore the diagram and look for performance anomalies.
