+### AKA "Where'd that plugin go??"
+
+In version 1.4.0 of Logstash, some of the community-contributed plugins were
+moved to a new home in the
+[Elasticsearch logstash-contrib repo](https://github.com/elasticsearch/logstash-contrib).
+If you can't find a plugin here which you've previously used, odds are it is now
+located there. The good news is that these plugins are simple to install using the
+[Logstash manual plugin installation script](http://logstash.net/docs/1.4.0/contrib-plugins).
