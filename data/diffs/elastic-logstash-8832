-=== Logstash 6.0.0 Release Notes
-
-* This list does not include all breaking changes, please consult the <<breaking-changes,breaking changes>> document separately.
-* Added new `logstash.yml` setting: `config.support_escapes`. When enabled, Logstash will interpret escape sequences in
-  strings in the pipeline configuration.
-* Added an explicit --setup phase for modules. This phase is used to install dashboards and the Elasticsearch template.
-* Added support for running multiple pipelines in the same Logstash instance. Running multiple pipelines
-  allows users to isolate data flow, provide separate runtime pipeline parameters and helps simplify complex
-  configurations. This can be configured via the new `pipelines.yml` file.
-* https://github.com/elastic/logstash/commit/840439722d8ef4737c7e8101c59652ced191bbea[Improved performance].
-* https://github.com/elastic/logstash/commit/546951fa889902d8ec56f8a7cec1dc41a21088ff[Modules: Set default credentials for Kibana if es info is present].
-* A variety of small consistency and testing fixes for the Windows platform
-* https://github.com/elastic/logstash/pull/8318[Added all commercially supported plugins to bundled plugins].
-* The existing `JAVA_OPTS` env var is now ignored for consistency with Elasticsearch.
-* JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS env var is cleared for consistency with Elasticsearch.
-* Now only LS_JAVA_OPTS env var is supported to append options to parsed options from the jvm.options file.
-* Dropped support for the LS_JVM_OPTS environment variable.
-* Dropped support for the USE_RUBY and USE_DRIP environment variables.
-* Added `cloud.id` and `cloud.auth` support for modules to provide an easy way to integrate with Elastic Cloud service.
-* Enabled DLQ support for multipipelines.
-* Added an {xpack} feature to manage Logstash configurations centrally in Elasticsearch. We've also added a UI to manage
-  configurations directly in Kibana without having to restart Logstash.
-* Users can now visualize the Logstash configuration pipeline as part of the {xpack} monitoring feature.

-==== Plugins
-
-* `GeoIP Filter`: You can now use MaxMind's commercial database to get enriched Geo information. ASN data can be
-  obtained via the GeoIP2-ISP database.

+* Added support for changing the <<configuring-persistent-queues,page capacity>> for an existing queue ({lsissue}8628[Issue 8628]).
