 NOTE: Referencing keystore data from {logstash-ref}/logstash-centralized-pipeline-management.html[centralized pipeline management]
 requires each Logstash deployment to have a local copy of the keystore.
 
+NOTE: The {ls} keystore needs to be protected, but the {ls} user must
+have access to the file. While most things in {ls} can be protected with
+`chown -R root:root <foo>`, the keystore itself must be accessible from the
+{ls} user. Use `chown logstash:root <keystore> && chmod 0600
+<keystore>`.

 When Logstash parses the settings (`logstash.yml`) or configuration
 (`/etc/logstash/conf.d/*.conf`), it resolves keys from the keystore before
 resolving environment variables.
