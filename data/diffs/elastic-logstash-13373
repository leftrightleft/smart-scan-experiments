-coming[8.0.0-beta1]
+==== Breaking changes
+
+[[rn-java-11-minimum]]
+===== Java 11 minimum
+Starting from Logstash 8.0, the minimum required version of Java to run Logstash is Java 11. By default, Logstash will
+run with the bundled JDK, which has been verified to work with each specific version of Logstash, and generally
+provides the best performance and reliability.
+
+See <<breaking-changes>> for a preview of additional breaking changes coming your way. 
+
+==== New features and enhancements
+
+[[rn-nanosecond-precision]]
+===== Nanosecond precision
+As processing times speed up, millisecond granularity is not always enough. Inbound data increasingly has sub-millisecond granularity timestamps.
+The pull request https://github.com/elastic/logstash/pull/12797[#12797] allows the internal mechanisms of Logstash that hold moment-in-time data - such as the Logstash Event, the Persistent Queue, the Dead Letter Queue and JSON encoding/decoding - to have nanosecond granularity.
+
+Timestamp precision is limited to the JVM and Platform's available granularity, which in many cases is microseconds.
+
+This change also grants users access to https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/time/format/DateTimeFormatter.html#patterns[Java time's improved formatters], which include support fort ISO quarters, week-of-month, and a variety of timezone/offset-related format substitutions. For example:
+
+[source,json]
+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
+filter {
+  mutate {
+    add_field => {"nanos" => "Nanos: %{{n}}" }
+  }
+}
+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
+
+Results in the following event:
+
+[source,json]
+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
+{
+    "@timestamp" => 2021-10-31T22:32:34.747968Z,
