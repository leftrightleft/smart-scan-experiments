+[[ruby-engine]]
+===== Ruby Execution Engine removed
+The Java Execution Engine has been the default engine since Logstash 7.0, and works with plugins written in either Ruby or Java.
+Removal of the Ruby Execution Engine will not affect the ability to run existing pipelines. https://github.com/elastic/logstash/pull/12517[#12517]
 
+[[utf-16]]
+===== Support for UTF-16
+We have added support for UTF-16 and other multi-byte-character when reading log files. https://github.com/elastic/logstash/pull/9702[#9702]

+[[field-ref-parser]]
+===== Field Reference parser removed
+The Field Reference parser interprets references to fields in your pipelines and
+plugins. It was configurable in 7.x, with the default set to strict to reject
+inputs that are ambiguous or illegal. Configurability is removed in 8.0. Now
+{ls} rejects ambiguous and illegal inputs as standard behavior. https://github.com/elastic/logstash/pull/12466[#12466]
+
+==== New features and enhancements
+
+**Option to pass custom data to the benchmark CLI**
+
+We have added another flag to the Benckmark CLI to allow passing a data file with previously captured data to the custom test case.
+This feature allows users to run the Benchmark CLI in a custom test case with a custom config and a custom dataset. https://github.com/elastic/logstash/pull/12437[#12437]
+
+==== Plugin releases
+Plugins align with release 7.14.0
