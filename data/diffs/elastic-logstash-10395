 Dead letter queues are stored as files in the local directory of the Logstash

+===== Disk Usage
 
-Dead letter queues have a built-in file rotation policy that manages the file
-size of the queue. When the file size reaches a preconfigured threshold, a new
-file is created automatically.

-By default, the maximum size of each dead letter queue is set to 1024mb. To
-change this setting, use the `dead_letter_queue.max_bytes` option.  Entries
