+=== Logstash 7.17.8 Release Notes
+
+* Eliminated unnecessary warning log from status log4j logger when new codecs are created by clone. https://github.com/elastic/logstash/pull/14727[#14727]
+* Fixed an issue that occurred during process shutdown in which the stalled shutdown watcher incorrectly reported inflight_count as 0 even when there are events in-flight. https://github.com/elastic/logstash/pull/14760[#14760]
+
+[[dependencies-7-17-8]]
+==== Updates to dependencies
+
+* Updated bundled JDK to 11.0.17+8 https://github.com/elastic/logstash/pull/14729[#14729]
+
+[[plugins-7-17-8]]
+==== Plugins
+
+*Cef Codec - 6.2.6*
+
+* Fix: When decoding, escaped newlines and carriage returns in extension values are now correctly decoded into literal newlines and carriage returns respectively https://github.com/logstash-plugins/logstash-codec-cef/pull/98[#98]
+* Fix: When decoding, non-CEF payloads are identified and intercepted to prevent data-loss and corruption. They now cause a descriptive log message to be emitted, and are emitted as their own `_cefparsefailure`-tagged event containing the original bytes in its `message` field https://github.com/logstash-plugins/logstash-codec-cef/issues/99[#99]
+* Fix: When decoding while configured with a `delimiter`, flushing this codec now correctly consumes the remainder of its internal buffer. This resolves an issue where bytes that are written without a trailing delimiter could be lost https://github.com/logstash-plugins/logstash-codec-cef/issues/100[#100] 
+
+*Grok Filter - 4.4.3*
+
+* [DOC] Fixed minor typos in docs examples https://github.com/logstash-plugins/logstash-filter-grok/pull/176[#176]
+
+*Tcp Output - 6.0.3*
+
+* Pulled applicable back-ports from 6.1.0 https://github.com/logstash-plugins/logstash-output-tcp/pull/50[#50]
+** Fix: Ensure sockets are closed when this plugin is closed
+** Fix: Fixes an issue in client mode where payloads larger than a connection's current TCP window could be silently truncated
+** Fix: Fixes an issue in server mode where payloads larger than a connection's current TCP window could be silently truncated
