 The `cloneCodec` method should return an identical instance of the codec with the exception of its ID. Because codecs
-may be stateful, a separate instance of each codec must be supplied to each worker thread in a pipeline. For all
-pipelines with more than one worker, the `cloneCodec` method is called by the Logstash execution engine to create all 
-codec instances beyond the first. In the example above, the codec is cloned with the same delimiter but a different ID.
