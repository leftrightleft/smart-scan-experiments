+=== Logstash 7.9.0 Release Notes
+
+==== New features and enhancements
+
+===== ECS support in Elasticsearch output plugin
+
+This release is the first step toward Elastic Common Schema (ECS) support in
+{ls}. With 7.9, you can configure the <<plugins-outputs-elasticsearch,{es}
+output plugin>> to manage index templates that are compatible with the
+{ecs-ref}[Elastic Common Schema (ECS)]. The
+<<plugins-outputs-elasticsearch-ecs_compatibility,ECS compatibility setting>>
+in the {es} output plugin makes this possible. 
+
+See
+{logstash-ref}/plugins-outputs-elasticsearch.html#_compatibility_with_the_elastic_common_schema_ecs[Compatibility with the Elastic Common Schema (ECS)]
+in the {es} output plugin docs for more information.
+
+===== Expanded API key support
+
+With this release, we've continued expanding support for {es} API keys. Support
+for API keys in the <<plugins-outputs-elasticsearch,{es} output plugin>> arrived
+in {ls} 7.8.0. {ls} 7.9.0 introduces support for {es} API keys in the
+<<plugins-inputs-elasticsearch,{es} input plugin>>, the
+<<plugins-filters-elasticsearch,{es} filter plugin>>, and {ls}
+<<ls-api-key-monitor,monitoring>> and <<ls-api-key-man,management>>. 
+
+Check out <<ls-api-keys>> for more information about using API keys with {ls}
+and {es}. 
+Implementation details are in https://github.com/elastic/logstash/pull/11953[#11953].
+
+===== ARM64 support (experimental)
+
+{ls} runs on arm machines! We have tested {ls} against arm64, and we are looking
+to make docker and other images available soon.
+
+ARM artifacts are not yet supported for production, and weâ€™re offering them as
+"experimental" to early adopters.
+
+===== Improved support in App Search output
+
+We replaced the deprecated Java client library for the
+<<plugins-outputs-elastic_app_search,Elastic App Search output plugin>> with the
+Ruby client library, and expanded integration testing. These changes provide a
+foundation for expanding App Search integration and quality assurance in future
+releases. 
+
+===== Improvements to persistent queue (PQ)
+
+We've enhanced persistent queues to better manage exceptions and error handling
+which could sometimes result in  a `LockException` when the queue file lock was
+not properly released. Under some conditions, a complex pipeline that is slower
+to initialize could be recreated when it was not done initializing, causing a
+`LockException`. Implementation details are in https://github.com/elastic/logstash/pull/12023[#12023].
+
+These changes result in better stability of persistent queues.
+
+===== Improvements to pipeline workers error handling
+
+Worker threads were not correctly monitored for a worker loop exception
+resulting in a complete logstash crash upon any exception even when multiple
+pipelines are running. Now only the failed pipeline is terminated. If pipeline
+reloading is enabled, you can edit the config and have the failed pipeline
+reloaded. 
+Implementation details are in
+https://github.com/elastic/logstash/pull/12019[#12019] and
+https://github.com/elastic/logstash/pull/12038[#12038].
+
+===== Performance improvement on startup and pipeline restarts
+
+This release contains several optimizations to pipeline compilation, an
+essential step of the pipeline initialization process. These changes
+significantly improve startup and pipeline-restart performance for complex
+pipelines.  
+(For technical details, check out this PR: https://github.com/elastic/logstash/pull/12060[#12060].)
+
+From our tests in three different pipelines with eight workers each, we have
+seen times decrease from 9 - 28 minutes to around 1 minute.
+
+To aid the development of pipelines, especially the performance impact of
+compilation, Logstash now reports the time taken to compile each pipeline as a
+log entry such as:
+
+[source,sh]

+[2020-08-12T14:10:29,388][INFO ][logstash.javapipeline  ][main] Pipeline Java execution initialization time {"seconds"=>0.7}
