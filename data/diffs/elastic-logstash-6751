+On some Linux systems, you may also need to have the `JAVA_HOME` environment
+exported before attempting the install, particularly if you installed Java from
+a tarball.  This is because Logstash uses Java during installation to
+automatically detect your environment and install the correct startup method
+(SysV init scripts, Upstart, or systemd).  If Logstash is unable to find the
+JAVA_HOME environment variable during package installation time, you may get an
+error message, and Logstash will be unable to start properly.
