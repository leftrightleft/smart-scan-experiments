 ==== New features and improvements
 
-===== Expanded JDK ecosystem 
-
-We have improved test scripts infrastructure to accept a specific Java
-Development Kit (JDK) present in the host. The changes include exporting the
-path to a JDK home into an environment variable named BUILD_JAVA_HOME and its
-use by shell scripts to launch test and integration scripts. This work and other
-JDK14 fixes pave the way for Logstash to support both AdoptOpenJDK 11 and 14 in
-the near future . https://github.com/elastic/logstash/pull/11786[#11786],

-Development Kit (JDK), and we’ve expanded this coverage in 7.8.0. {ls} has
