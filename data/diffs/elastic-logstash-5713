 Logstash has the following flags. You can use the `--help` flag to display this information.
 
-You can also control Logstash execution by specifying options in the Logstash settings file. For more info, see <<logstash-settings-file>>.  
+Instead of specifying options at the command line, we recommend that you control Logstash execution
+by specifying options in the Logstash <<logstash-settings-file,settings file>>. Using a settings file
+makes it easier for you to specify mutliple options, and it provides you with a single, versionable
+file that you can use to start up Logstash consistently for each run. 
+
+Any flags that you set at the command line override the corresponding settings in the Logstash
+<<logstash-settings-file,settings file>>.
