+== Configuration Management
+
+Logstash provides configuration management features to make it easier for you to
+manage updates to your configuration over time.
+
+The topics in this section describe Logstash configuration management features
+only. For information about other config management tools, such as Puppet and
+Chef, see the documentation for those projects. Also take a look at the
+https://forge.puppet.com/elastic/logstash[Logstash Puppet module documentation].

+=== Centralized Pipeline Management
+
+NOTE: Centralized pipeline management is an {xpack} feature that requires a
+paid {xpack} license. See the
+https://www.elastic.co/subscriptions[Elastic Subscriptions] page for
+information about obtaining a license.
+
+The pipeline management feature in {xpack} centralizes the creation and
+management of Logstash configuration pipelines. From within the pipeline
+management UI, you can control multiple Logstash instances. You can add, edit,
+and delete pipeline configurations. On the Logstash side, you simply need
+to register Logstash to use the centrally managed pipeline configurations. 
+
+The pipeline configurations, along with some metadata, are stored in
+Elasticsearch. Any changes that you make to a pipeline definition in the UI are
+picked up and loaded automatically by all Logstash instances registered to use
+the pipeline. The changes are applied immediately; you do not have to restart
+Logstash to pick up the changes, as long as Logtash is already registered to
+use the pipeline. 
+
+To use centralized pipeline management, you must install {xpack} and specify
+the configuration management settings described in
+{logstash-ref}/setup-xpack.html[Setting up {xpack}].
+
+IMPORTANT: After you've configured Logstash to use centralized pipeline
+management, you can no longer specify local pipeline configurations. This
+means that the `pipelines.yml` file and settings like `path.config` and
+`config.string` are inactive when this feature is enabled.
+
+==== Pipeline management UI
+
+To access the pipeline management UI, open {kib} in your browser and go to
+the Management tab. If you've set up configuration management correctly, you'll
+see an area for managing Logstash. Click the *Pipelines* link.
+
+image::static/images/centralized_config.png[]
+
+Here you can add, edit, or delete Logstash pipeline configurations.
+
+To add a new pipeline, click the *Add* button and specify values for the
+following fields:
+
+[horizontal]
+Pipeline ID::
+A name that uniquely identifies the pipeline. You use this ID when you set up
+{logstash-ref}/configuration-management-settings.html[configuration management]
+and specify a list of pipeline IDs in the `xpack.management.pipeline.id` setting.
+
+Version::
+A string value that you can use as metadata to track the version of the pipeline
+configuration. For example, `v1.0.0`. This information is for your use. Logtash
+doesn't currently manage or validate the version information.
+
+Description::
+A description of the pipeline configuration. This information is for your use.
+
+Pipeline::
+The pipeline configuration. You can treat the editor in the pipeline management
+UI like any other editor. You don't have to worry about whitespace or indentation. 
+
+image::static/images/new_pipeline.png[]
+
+When you click *Save*, the pipeline runs on all Logstash instances that are
+registered to use the pipeline. There is no validation done at the UI level.
+The UI will save the new configuration, and Logstash will attempt to load it.
+You need to check the local Logstash logs for configuration errors. If you're
+using the Logstash monitoring feature in {xpack}, you can also navigate to the
+Monitoring tab to check the status of your Logstash nodes.
+
+You can specify multiple pipeline configurations that run in parallel on the
+same Logstash node.
+
+If you edit a pipeline configuration and save the changes, Logstash reloads
+the configuration in the background and continues processing events.
+
+If you delete a pipeline (for example, `apache`) from the UI, Logstash will
+attempt to stop the pipeline if it's running. Logstash will wait until all
+events have been fully processed by the pipeline. Before deleting a pipeline,
+make sure you understand your data sources because stopping a pipeline may
+lead to data loss.
