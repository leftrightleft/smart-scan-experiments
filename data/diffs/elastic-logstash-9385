 You can set up communication between two Logstash machines by connecting the Lumberjack output to the Beats input. You may need this configuration if the data path crosses network or firewall boundaries, for example. If you don't have a compelling need for Logstash-to-Logstash communication, then don't implement it.

 ===== How it works
 
-The `pipeline` input acts as a virtual server listening on a single virtual address in the local process. Only `pipeline` outputs running on the same local Logstash can send events to this address. Pipeline `outputs` can send events to a list of virtual addresses. A `pipeline` output will block if the downstream pipeline is either unavailable or blocked.

-Copying events does, however incur a performance cost. While the `pipeline` plugin may be the most efficient way to communicate between pipelines it still does incur a cost. Logstash must duplicate each event in full on the Java heap for each downstream pipeline a `pipeline` output sends to. Beware that using this feature may affect the heap memory utilization of Logstash.

 [[avoid-cycles]]
 ===== Avoid cycles
 
-It is important when connecting pipelines that the data only flow in one direction. Looping data back around, or connecting the pipelines into a cyclic graph, can cause problems. Logstash waits for each pipeline's work to complete before shutting down. If the pipelines loop data between them this can prevent Logstash from cleanly shutting down.

+===== The distributor pattern
 
-The Distributor pattern is used in situations where there are multiple types of data coming through a single input, each with its own complex set of processing rules. With the distributor pattern one pipeline is used to route data to other pipelines based on type. Each type is routed to a pipeline with only the logic for handling that type. In this way each type's logic can be isolated.

-As an example, in many organizations a single beats input may be used to receive traffic from a variety of sources, each with its own processing logic. A common way of dealing with this type of data is to have a number of `if` conditions separating the traffic and processing each type differently. This approach can quickly get messy when configs are long and complex.

+You can use the output isolator pattern to prevent Logstash from becoming blocked if one of multiple outputs experiences a temporary failure. Logstash, by default, is blocked when any single output is down. This behavior is important in guaranteeing at-least-once delivery of data. 
 
-The output isolator pattern is used to prevent Logstash from blocking in the case where there are multiple outputs and one output experiences a temporary failure. For example, a server might be configured to send log data to both Elasticsearch and an HTTP endpoint. It might be the case that the HTTP endpoint is frequently unavailable due to regular service or some other reason.
+For example, a server might be configured to send log data to both Elasticsearch and an HTTP endpoint. The HTTP endpoint might be frequently unavailable due to regular service or other reasons. In this scenario, data would be paused from sending to Elasticsearch any time the HTTP endpoint is down. 
 
-Logstash, by default, will block when any single output is down. This is an important behavior in guaranteeing at-least-once delivery of data. Unfortunately, in our above scenario this means that whenever the HTTP endpoint is down data is also paused from sending to Elasticsearch. Using the `pipeline` input and output, along with persistent queues, we can continue sending to Elasticsearch even when one output is down, by using the output isolator pattern.
