 Not a type in and of itself, but a property types can have.
 This makes it possible to type check multiple values.
 Plugin authors can enable list checking by specifying `:list => true` when declaring an argument.

 A URI can be anything from a full URL like 'http://elastic.co/' to a simple identifier
 like 'foobar'. If the URI contains a password such as 'http://user:pass@example.net' the password
 portion of the URI will not be logged or printed.
