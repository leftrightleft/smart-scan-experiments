+NOTE: In Logstash 7.x and earlier, a quoted value (such as `["foo"]`) is
+considered a field reference and isn't treated as a single element array. This
+behavior might cause confusion in conditionals, such as `[message] in ["foo",
+"bar"]` compared to `[message] in ["foo"]`. We discourage using names with
+quotes, such as `"\"foo\""`, as this behavior might change in the future.
