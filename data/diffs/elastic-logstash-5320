+## Issue Prioritization
+The Logstash team takes time to digest, consider solutions, and weigh applicability of issues to both the broad
+Logstash user base and our own goals for the project. Through this process, we assign issues a priority using GitHub
+labels. Below is a description of priority labels.
+
+* P1: A high priority issue that affects almost all Logstash users. Bugs that would cause data loss, security
+issues and test failures. Workarounds for P1s generally donâ€™t exist without a code change. A P1 issue is usually
+stop the world kinda scenario, so we need to make sure P1s are properly triaged and being worked upon.
+* P2: A broadly applicable, high visibility issue that enhances Logstash usability for a majority of users.
+* P3: Nice-to-have bug fixes or functionality.  Workarounds for P3s generally exist.
+* P4: Anything not in above, catch-all label.
