+==== Beats Input Config Change
 
 The Beats input has been reimplemented using Netty, an asynchronous IO framework for Java.
 This rewrite for performance brings the plugin in line with the Logstash Forwarder + LS combination.
 As part of the Beats refactor, we now only support private keys in PKCS#8 format. You can easily convert existing keys to use the PKCS#8 format by using the OpenSSL Toolkit. See the https://www.openssl.org/docs/manmaster/apps/pkcs8.html[OpenSSL] documentation.

+=== Changes in 2.2
+
 Although 2.2 is fully compatible with configurations from older versions, there are some architectural 
 changes to the pipeline that users need to take into consideration before deploying in production. 
 These changes are not strictly "breaking" in the semantic versioning sense, but they make Logstash behave differently 
 in runtime, and can also affect performance. We have compiled such a list in the <<upgrading-logstash-2.2>> section. 
 Please review it before deploying 2.2 version.

-=== Metrics Filter Changes

 Prior implementations of the metrics filter plugin used dotted field names. Elasticsearch does not allow field names to
 have dots, beginning with version 2.0, so a change was made to use sub-fields instead of dots in this plugin. Please note
 that these changes make version 3.0.0 of the metrics filter plugin incompatible with previous releases.
