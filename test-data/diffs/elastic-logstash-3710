+A string must be a single character sequence. Note that string values are
+enclosed in quotes, either double or single. Literal quotes in the string
+need to be escaped with a backslash if they are of the same kind as the string
+delimiter, i.e. single quotes within a single-quoted string need to be escaped
+as well as double quotes within a double-quoted string.
 
 Example:
 
 [source,js]
 ----------------------------------
   name => "Hello world"
+  name => 'It\'s a beautiful day'
