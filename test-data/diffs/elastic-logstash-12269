+The dead letter queue (DLQ) can provide another layer of data resilience. 
 
 By default, when Logstash encounters an event that it cannot process because the
 data contains a mapping error or some other issue, the Logstash pipeline 
 either hangs or drops the unsuccessful event. In order to protect against data
 loss in this situation, you can <<configuring-dlq,configure Logstash>> to write

+**HTTP request failure.** If the HTTP request fails (because {es} is unreachable
+or because it returned an HTTP error code), the {es} output retries the entire
+request indefinitely. In these scenarios, the dead letter queue has no
+opportunity to intercept.
+
+**HTTP request success.** The {ref}/docs-bulk.html[{es} Bulk API] can perform
+multiple actions using the same request. If the Bulk API request is successful,
+it returns `200 OK`, even if some documents in the batch have
+{ref}/docs-bulk.html#bulk-failures-ex[failed]. In this situation, the `errors`
+flag for the request will be `true`.
+
+The response body can include metadata indicating that one or more specific
+actions in the bulk request could not be performed, along with an HTTP-style
+status code per entry to indicate why the action could not be performed.
+If the DLQ is configured, individual indexing failures are routed there.
