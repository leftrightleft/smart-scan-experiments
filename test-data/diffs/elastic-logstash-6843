+=== Logstash 5.3.0 Breaking Changes
+
+This section discusses the changes that you need to be aware of when migrating your application 
+from Logstash 5.2 to 5.3.
+
+[float]
+==== Changes in Logstash Core
+
+==== Persistent queue
+
+The default location on disk where the queue data is stored has been changed from `<path.data>/queue` to 
+`<path.data>/queue/main`. The directory hierarchy now includes the pipeline ID which defaults to `main`. 
+This change was made to accommodate an upcoming feature where multiple, isolated pipelines can be run on 
+the same Logstash instance. In this future situation, each pipeline will have its own queue; hence the new directory 
+structure.
+
+**Upgrading to 5.3**
+
+If you are using the persistent queue feature and intend to upgrade to 5.3:
+
+* Ensure you completely drain the queue data in 5.2 by stopping the incoming data and processing all of the 
+  in-flight events.
+* Stop Logstash and manually move the files under `<path.data>/queue/` to `<path.data>/queue/main` before upgrading to 5.3.
+* If you do not intend to process the data currently buffered in the queue in 5.2, you can manually delete 
+  the `path.data/queue` directory before upgrading to 5.3.
+
+[float]
+==== Breaking Changes in Plugins
+
+*`KV filter`*: `trim` and `trimkey` options are renamed to `trim_value` and `trim_key` respectively. Their behavior has been 
+changed as well to _trim_ the characters at the beginning or end of the values.

+== Release Notes
+
+This section summarizes the changes in the following releases:
+
+* <<logstash-5-3-0,Logstash 5.3.0>>
+
+[[logstash-5-3-0]]
+=== Logstash 5.3.0 Release Notes
+
+
+* Persistent queues:
+    ** Changed the default queue location on disk to include the pipeline's ID in the path hierarchy.
+       By default, the queue is now created under `<path.data>/queue/main`. This breaking change was made to
+       accommodate an upcoming feature where multiple, isolated pipelines could be run on the same Logstash
+       instance.
+    ** Added a recovery process that runs during Logstash startup to recover data that has been written to the 
+       persistent queue, but not yet checkpointed. This is useful in situations where the input has written data to 
+       the queue, but Logstash crashed before writing to the checkpoint file.
+    ** Added exclusive access to the persistent queue on disk, as defined by the `path.queue` setting. Using a file 
+       lock guards against corruption by ensuring that only a single Logstash instance has access to write to the 
+       queue on the same path. ({lsissue}6604[Issue 6604]).
+    ** You can now safely reload the pipeline config when using persistent queues. Previously, reloading the 
+       config could result in data corruption. In 5.3, the reload sequence has been changed to reliably shut down the
+       first pipeline before a new one is started with the same settings.
+    ** Fixed an issue where Logstash would stop accepting new events when queue capacity is reached even though events
+       were successfully acknowledged ({lsissue}6626[Issue 6626]).
+
+* Fixed a warning message when --config.debug is used with --log.level=debug  ({lsissue}6256[Issue 6256]).
+
+
+[float]
+==== Input Plugins
+
+*`S3`*:
+
+* We now include the S3 key information in the metadata (https://github.com/logstash-plugins/logstash-input-s3/issues/105[Issue 105]).
+
+*`Unix`*:
+
+* The `host` and `path` fields are no longer overwritten if they are already provided by `add_field` config.
+
+==== Filter Plugins
+
+*`KV`*:
+
+* Breaking: The `trim` and `trimkey` options are renamed to `trim_value` and `trim_key` respectively (https://github.com/logstash-plugins/logstash-filter-kv/issues/10[Issue 10]).
+* `trim_value` only removes the specified leading and trailing characters from the value. Similarly, `trim_key`
+  only removes the specified leading and trailing characters from the key (https://github.com/logstash-plugins/logstash-filter-kv/issues/10[Issue 10]).
+* Added new options `remove_char_value` and `remove_char_key` to remove the specified characters from keys
+  (or values) regardless of where these characters are found (https://github.com/logstash-plugins/logstash-filter-kv/issues/10[Issue 10]).
+
+*`Grok`*:
+
+* Added an option to define custom patterns using `pattern_definitions` configuration.
+
+==== Output Plugins
+
+*`S3`*:
+
+* Fixed to use the correct `signature_version` for the SDK v2 library (https://github.com/logstash-plugins/logstash-output-csv/issues/129[Issue 129]).
+* Fixed an issue which resulted in uploading empty files to S3 when using gzip compression (https://github.com/logstash-plugins/logstash-output-s3/issues/95[Issue 95]).
+
+*`CSV`*:
+
+* Updated to work with the 5.0 event API and threading contracts (https://github.com/logstash-plugins/logstash-output-csv/issues/10[Issue 10]).
