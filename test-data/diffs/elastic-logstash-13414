-==== Changes in Logstash Core
+[[bc-java-11-minimum]]
+===== Java 11 minimum
+Logstash requires Java 11 or later.
+By default, Logstash will run with the bundled JDK, which has been verified to
+work with each specific version of Logstash, and generally provides the best
+performance and reliability.
+
+[discrete]
+[[bc-java-home]]
+===== Support for JAVA_HOME removed
+We've removed support for using `JAVA_HOME` to override the path to the JDK. 
+Users who need to use a version other than the bundled JDK should set the value
+of `LS_JAVA_HOME` to the path of their preferred JDK. 
+The value of `JAVA_HOME` will be ignored.
