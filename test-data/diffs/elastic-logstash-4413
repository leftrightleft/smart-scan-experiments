 -w, --filterworkers COUNT
- Sets the number of filter workers to run (default: half the number of cores)
+ Sets the number of pipeline workers (threads) to run for filter and output

+ If you find that events are backing up, or that the CPU is not saturated, consider increasing

+
+-b, --pipeline-batch-size SIZE
+ This parameter defines the maximum number of events an individual worker thread will collect
+ before attempting to execute its filters and outputs. Larger batch sizes are generally more 
+ efficient, but come at the cost of increased memory overhead. You may have to increase the 
+ JVM heap size by setting the `LS_HEAP_SIZE` variable to effectively use the option.
+
+-u, --pipeline-batch-delay DELAY_IN_MS
+ When creating pipeline event batches, how long to wait while polling for the next event.
