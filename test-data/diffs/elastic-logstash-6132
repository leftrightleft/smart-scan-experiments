-=== Upgrading Logstash to 2.2
+==== When Not to Upgrade
 
-Logstash 2.2 re-architected the pipeline stages to provide more performance and help future enhancements in resiliency.
-The new pipeline introduced micro-batches, processing groups of events at a time. The default batch size is
-125 per worker. Also, the filter and output stages are executed in the same thread, but still, as different stages.
-The CLI flag `--pipeline-workers` or `-w` control the number of execution threads, which is set by default to number of cores.
+If any Logstash plugin that you require is not compatible with Logstash 5.0, then you should wait until it is ready
+before upgrading.
 
-**Considerations for Elasticsearch Output**
-The default batch size of the pipeline is 125 events per worker. This will by default also be the bulk size
-used for the elasticsearch output. The Elasticsearch output's `flush_size` now acts only as a maximum bulk
-size (still defaulting to 500). For example, if your pipeline batch size is 3000 events, Elasticsearch
-Output will send 500 events at a time, in 6 separate bulk requests. In other words, for Elasticsearch output,
-bulk request size is chunked based on `flush_size` and `--pipeline.batch.size`. If `flush_size` is set greater
-than `--pipeline.batch.size`, it is ignored and `--pipeline.batch.size` will be used.
+Although we make great efforts to ensure compatibility, Logstash 5.0 is not completely backwards compatible. As noted
+in the Elastic Stack upgrade guide, Logstash 5.0 should not be upgraded before Elasticsearch 5.0. This is both
+practical and because some Logstash 5.0 plugins may attempt to use features of Elasticsearch 5.0 that did not exist
+in earlier versions. For example, if you attempt to send the 5.x template to a cluster before Elasticsearch 5.0, then it
+will not be able to use it and all indexing will fail likely fail. If you use your own, custom template with Logstash,
+then this issue can be ignored.
 
-The default number of output workers in Logstash 2.2 is now equal to the number of pipeline workers (`-w`)
-unless overridden in the Logstash config file. This can be problematic for some users as the
-extra workers may consume extra resources like file handles, especially in the case of the Elasticsearch
-output. Users with more than one Elasticsearch host may want to override the `workers` setting
-for the Elasticsearch output in their Logstash config to constrain that number to a low value, between 1 to 4.
+Note the Elasticsearch Output Index Template change in the <<breaking-changes>> documentation for further insight into
+this change and how it impacts operations.
 
-**Performance Tuning in 2.2**
-Since both filters and output workers are on the same thread, this could lead to threads being idle in I/O wait state.
-Thus, in 2.2, you can safely set `-w` to a number which is a multiple of the number of cores on your machine.
-A common way to tune performance is keep increasing the `-w` beyond the # of cores until performance no longer
-improves. A note of caution - make sure you also keep heapsize in mind, because the number of in-flight events
-are `#workers * batch_size * average_event size`. More in-flight events could add to memory pressure, eventually
-leading to Out of Memory errors. You can change the heapsize in Logstash by setting `LS_HEAP_SIZE`
