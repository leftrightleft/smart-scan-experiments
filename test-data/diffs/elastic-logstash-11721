+=== Logstash 7.7.0 Release Notes
+
+* Feature:  New Logstash monitoring option. +
+We added a new option for using internal collectors to send monitoring data
+directly to the monitoring cluster rather than the production cluster.
+https://github.com/elastic/logstash/pull/11106[#11106],  
+https://github.com/elastic/logstash/pull/11640[#11640],
+https://github.com/elastic/logstash/pull/11641[#11641] 
++
+Past implementations of internal collection sent monitoring data through a
+production Elasticsearch cluster which forwarded the data to a dedicated
+monitoring cluster. Now the internal collector can send monitoring data directly
+to the monitoring cluster. 
++
+Migrating from legacy internal collection to new
+<<monitoring-internal-collection,Internal collection>> is straightforward. 
+
+** Drop the `xpack.` prefix from your configuration settings. 
+For example, `xpack.monitoring.enabled` is now `monitoring.enabled`. See
+<<monitoring-settings, Monitoring Settings>> for the full list.
+** Change the hosts settings and configuration options to point to monitoring cluster instead of production
+** If you donâ€™t have an Elasticsearch output plugin configured in the pipelines,
+add the setting monitoring.cluster_uuid to your logstash.yml.
+
++
+See <<configuring-logstash, Monitoring Logstash>> for more information
+about this and other monitoring options.
+
+* Feature: Logging Improvements. +
+This release continues with the logging improvements we have been making
+recently. This release adds the plugin name to log entries and includes the
+previous changes made to add plugin and pipeline identifiers to the docker
+image:
+https://github.com/elastic/logstash/pull/11078[#11078],
+https://github.com/elastic/logstash/pull/11593[#11593],
+https://github.com/elastic/logstash/pull/11567[#11567]
+
+* Bugfix/Feature: The new `pipeline.ordered` setting gives users more control over
+event ordering for single worker pipelines. 
++
+Historically, {ls} events ordering between an input plugin and output plugin
+were preserved when a single worker executed a pipeline. This behaviour was
+never officially documented, but it was a feature that many users relied upon.
++
+When the Java Execution engine was introduced, it broke the single worker
+ordering preservation. This bug was fixed with the introduction of the
+pipeline.ordered setting. 
+https://github.com/elastic/logstash/pull/11552[#11552], 
+https://github.com/elastic/logstash/pull/11710[#11710]
++
+The `pipeline.ordered` setting is in <<logstash-settings-file,`logstash.yml`>>.
+Valid options are `auto`, `true`, or `false`.
+
+* Fixed: Add `sudo` into the rpm import of GPG-KEY https://github.com/elastic/logstash/pull/11684[#11684]
+* Fixed: Use lightweight regex matching (which does not depend on frames) https://github.com/elastic/logstash/pull/11653[#11653]
+* Fixed: Issue where monitoring API does not properly resolve ids including environment variable expansion https://github.com/elastic/logstash/pull/11592[#11592]
+* Fixed: Change Javadoc to conform to updated requirements for JDK13 https://github.com/elastic/logstash/pull/11642[#11642]
