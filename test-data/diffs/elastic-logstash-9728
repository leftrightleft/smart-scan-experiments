+=== Logstash 5.6.10 Release Notes
+* Backport new PQ implementation
+* Fix Cloner to properly clone ruby strings
+
+*Netflow Codec*
+
+* Fixes exception when receiving Netflow 9 from H3C devices
+* Added support for Netflow 9 from H3C devices
+* Fixes incorrect definitions of IE 231 and IE 232
+* Fixes exceptions due to concurrent access of IPFIX templates, see issue #134
+* Added support for Netflow 9 reduced-size encoding support
+* Added support for Barracuda IPFIX Extended Uniflow
+* Added support for IPFIX from Procera/NetIntact/Sandvine 15.1
+
+*Dns Filter*
+
+* Log timeouts as warn instead of error #43
+* Allow concurrent queries when cache enabled #42
+
+*Kv Filter*
+
+* bugfix: improves trim_key and trim_value to trim any sequence of matching characters from the beginning and ends of the corresponding keys and values; a previous implementation limited trim to a single character from each end, which was surprising.
+* bugfix: fixes issue where we can fail to correctly break up a sequence that includes a partially-quoted value followed by another fully-quoted value by slightly reducing greediness of quoted-value captures.
+
+*Mutate Filter*
+
+* Fix: when converting to float and float_eu, explicitly support same range of inputs as their integer counterparts; eliminates a regression introduced in 3.3.1 in which support for non-string inputs was inadvertently removed.
+
+*S3 Input*
+
+* #136 Avoid plugin crashes when encountering 'bad' files in S3 buckets
+* Log entry when bucket is empty #150
+* Symbolize hash keys for additional_settings hash #148
+
+*UDP Input*
+
+* Work around jruby/jruby#5148 by cloning messages on jruby 9k, therefore resizing the underlying byte buffer
+* Fix missing require for the ipaddr library.
+
+*S3 Output*
+
+* Symbolize hash keys for additional_settings hash #179
+* Docs: Set the default_codec doc attribute.
+
+*Elasticsearch Output*
+
+* Avoid infinite loop by checking for zero body size #737
+* Add support for join based parent indexing (backport of #632) #686
