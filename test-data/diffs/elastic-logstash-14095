-Be sure that your disk has sufficient capacity to handle the cumulative total of `queue.max_bytes` across all persistent queues.
-The total of `queue.max_bytes` for _all_ queues should be
-lower than the capacity of your disk.

 TIP: If you are using persistent queues to protect against data loss, but don't
 require much buffering, you can set `queue.max_bytes` to a smaller value.
 A smaller value produces smaller queues and improves queue performance.
