+* <<logstash-5-6-1,Logstash 5.6.1>>
 
-[[logstash-5-6-0]]
-=== Logstash 5.6.0 Release Notes
+[[logstash-5-6-1]]
+=== Logstash 5.6.1 Release Notes
 
-* Introduced modules for Netflow and ArcSight data. Modules contain pre-packaged Logstash configuration, Kibana dashboards 
-  and other metadata files to ease the set up of the Elastic stack for certain data sources. The goal of these modules are 
-  to provide an end-to-end, 5-min getting started experience for a user exploring a data source.
-* Added a new setting called `config.support_escapes`. This setting enables the use of escape characters such as `\n` in 
-  the Logstash configuration.
-* Improved the performance of metrics collection and reporting infrastructure. Overall, in this release, there is lower load 
-  average, less GC and higher throughput when running Logstash.
-* When processing events from the DLQ, there are added checks now to stop them from being written to the DLQ again.
-* Fixed an issue which would crash Logstash when accessing DLQ events using a timestamp range.
+* There are no user-facing changes in this release
