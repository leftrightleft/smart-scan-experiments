+# Dependency audit tool
+
+The dependency audit tool automates the verification of the following criteria for all
+third-party dependencies that are shipped as part of either Logstash core or the [default Logstash 
+plugins](https://github.com/elastic/logstash/blob/master/rakelib/plugins-metadata.json):
+* The dependency has been added to the [dependency list file](https://github.com/elastic/logstash/blob/master/tools/dependencies-report/src/main/resources/licenseMapping.csv)
+with an appropriate project URL and [SPDX license identifier](https://spdx.org/licenses/). 
+* The license for the dependency is among those [approved for distribution](https://github.com/elastic/logstash/blob/master/tools/dependencies-report/src/main/resources/acceptableLicenses.csv).
+* There is a corresponding `NOTICE.txt` file in the [notices folder](https://github.com/elastic/logstash/tree/master/tools/dependencies-report/src/main/resources/notices)
+containing the appropriate notices or license information for the dependency. These individual 
+notice files will be combined to form the notice file shipped with Logstash.
+
+The dependency audit tool enumerates all the dependencies, Ruby and Java, direct and transitive,
+for Logstash core and the default plugins. If any dependencies are found that do not conform to
+the criteria above, the name of the dependency(ies) along with instructions for resolving are 
+printed to the console and the tool exits with a non-zero return code.
