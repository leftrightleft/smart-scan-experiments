-===== Collectors
-
-Collectors, as their name implies, collect things. In monitoring for Logstash, 
-collectors are just <<pipeline,Inputs>> in the same way that ordinary Logstash 
-configurations provide inputs.
-
-Like monitoring for {es}, each collector can create zero or more monitoring 
-documents. As it is currently implemented, each Logstash node runs two types of 
-collectors: one for node stats and one for pipeline stats.
-
-[options="header"]
-|=======================
-| Collector       | Data Types | Description
-| Node Stats      | `logstash_stats`
-| Gathers details about the running node, such as memory utilization and CPU
-usage (for example, `GET /_stats`).
-
-This runs on every Logstash node with monitoring enabled. One common
-failure is that Logstash directories are copied with their `path.data` directory
-included (`./data` by default), which copies the persistent UUID of the Logstash
-node along with it. As a result, it generally appears that one or more Logstash
-nodes are failing to collect monitoring data, when in fact they are all really
-misreporting as the _same_ Logstash node. Re-use `path.data` directories only 
-when upgrading Logstash, such that upgraded nodes replace the previous versions.
-| Pipeline Stats | `logstash_state`
-| Gathers details about the node's running pipelines, which powers the 
-Monitoring Pipeline UI.
-|=======================
-
-Per collection interval, which defaults to 10 seconds (`10s`), each collector is
-run. The failure of an individual collector does not impact any other collector. 
-Each collector, as an ordinary Logstash input, creates a separate Logstash event 
-in its isolated monitoring pipeline. The Logstash output then sends the data.
-
-The collection interval can be configured dynamically and you can also disable 
-data collection. For more information about the configuration options for the 
-collectors, see <<monitoring-settings>>.
-
-WARNING: Unlike for {es} and {kib} monitoring, there is no
-`monitoring.collection.enabled` setting on Logstash. You must use the
-`monitoring.enabled` setting to enable and disable data collection.
-
-If gaps exist in the monitoring charts in {kib}, it is typically because either 
-a collector failed or the monitoring cluster did not receive the data (for 
-example, it was being restarted). In the event that a collector fails, a logged 
-error should exist on the node that attempted to perform the collection.

-++++
-<titleabbrev>Configure internal collection</titleabbrev>
-++++
-
-To monitor Logstash nodes:
-
-. Specify the location of the _monitoring cluster_. For examples of typical
-monitoring architectures, see {ref}/how-monitoring-works.html[How monitoring
-works] in the {ref}[Elasticsearch Reference].
-
-. Verify that the `xpack.monitoring.collection.enabled` setting is `true` on the
-monitoring cluster. If that setting is `false`, the collection of monitoring data
-is disabled in {es}, and data is ignored from all other sources.
-
-. Configure your Logstash nodes to send metrics by setting the
-`monitoring.elasticsearch.hosts` in `logstash.yml`. If {security-features}
-are enabled, you also need to specify the credentials for the
-{ref}/built-in-users.html[built-in `logstash_system` user]. For more
-information about these settings, see <<monitoring-settings>>.

-monitoring.elasticsearch.username: "logstash_system"
-monitoring.elasticsearch.password: "changeme"
---------------------------------------------------
-
-If SSL/TLS is enabled on the monitoring cluster, you must connect through HTTPS.
-You can specify a single host as a string, or multiple Elasticsearch hosts as an
-array. If multiple URLs are specified, Logstash can round-robin requests to
-these monitoring nodes.
---
-
-. If SSL/TLS is enabled on the monitoring {es} cluster, specify the trusted
-CA certificates that will be used to verify the identity of the nodes
-in the cluster.
-+
---
-To add a CA certificate to a Logstash node's trusted certificates, you
-can specify the location of the PEM encoded certificate with the
-`certificate_authority` setting:
-
-[source,yaml]
---------------------------------------------------
-monitoring.elasticsearch.ssl.certificate_authority: /path/to/ca.crt
---------------------------------------------------
-
-Alternatively, you can configure trusted certificates using a truststore
-(a Java Keystore file that contains the certificates):
-
-[source,yaml]
---------------------------------------------------
-monitoring.elasticsearch.ssl.truststore.path: /path/to/file
-monitoring.elasticsearch.ssl.truststore.password: password
---------------------------------------------------
-
-Also, optionally, you can set up client certificate using a keystore
-(a Java Keystore file that contains the certificate):
-
-[source,yaml]
---------------------------------------------------
-monitoring.elasticsearch.ssl.keystore.path: /path/to/file
-monitoring.elasticsearch.ssl.keystore.password: password
---------------------------------------------------
-
-Set sniffing to `true` to enable discovery of other nodes of the {es} cluster.
-It defaults to `false`.
-
-[source,yaml]
---------------------------------------------------
-monitoring.elasticsearch.sniffing: false
---------------------------------------------------
-
---
-
-. Restart your Logstash nodes.
-
-. To verify your monitoring configuration, point your web browser at your {kib}
-host, and select **Monitoring** from the side navigation. Metrics reported from
-your Logstash nodes should be visible in the Logstash section. When security is
-enabled, you must log in to {kib} as a user who has the `kibana_user` and
-`monitoring_user` roles.

-
-Monitoring {ls} with internal collectors uses these components:

-These pieces live outside of the default Logstash pipeline in a dedicated
-monitoring pipeline. This configuration ensures that all data and processing has
-a minimal impact on ordinary Logstash processing. 
-
-NOTE: The `elasticsearch` output for Logstash monitoring is configured
-exclusively through settings in `logstash.yml`.

-The monitoring {es} cluster should be configured to receive {ls} monitoring
-data directly from {ls}. For more information about typical monitoring

-==== Output
-
-Like all Logstash pipelines, the purpose of the dedicated monitoring pipeline is 
-to send events to outputs. In the case of Logstash monitoring, the output 
-is always an `elasticsearch` output. However, unlike ordinary Logstash pipelines, 
-the output is configured within the `logstash.yml` settings file via the
-`monitoring.elasticsearch.*` settings.
-

-
-[float]
-[[logstash-monitoring-default]]
-===== Default Configuration
-
-If a Logstash node does not explicitly define a monitoring output setting, 
-the following default configuration is used:
-
-[source,yaml]
----------------------------------------------------
-monitoring.elasticsearch.hosts: [ "http://localhost:9200" ]
----------------------------------------------------
-
-All data produced by Logstash monitoring is indexed in the monitoring 
-cluster using the `.monitoring-logstash` template. 
-
-If you are working with a cluster that has {security-features} enabled, extra
-steps are necessary to properly configure Logstash. For more information, see 
-<<configuring-logstash>>. 
-
-IMPORTANT: When discussing security relative to the `monitoring.elasticsearch`
-settings, remember that all users are managed on the monitoring cluster, which
-is identified in the `monitoring.elasticsearch.hosts` setting. This is
-particularly important when you move from development environments to production
-environments, where you often have dedicated monitoring clusters.
-
-For more information about the configuration options for the output, see

-
-You can set the following `monitoring` settings in `logstash.yml` to
-control how monitoring data is collected from your Logstash nodes. However, the
-defaults work best in most circumstances. For more information about configuring
-Logstash, see <<logstash-settings-file>>.
-
-
-[[monitoring-general-settings]]
-===== General monitoring settings
-
-`monitoring.enabled`::
-
-Monitoring is disabled by default. Set to `true` to enable monitoring.
-
-`monitoring.elasticsearch.hosts`::
-
-The {es} monitoring cluster that you want to ship your Logstash metrics to. This
-might be the same {es} instance specified in the `outputs` section in your
-Logstash configuration, or a dedicated monitoring cluster.  You can specify a
-single host as a string, or specify multiple hosts as an array. Defaults to
-`http://localhost:9200`.
-
-NOTE: If your Elasticsearch monitoring cluster is configured with dedicated
-master-eligible nodes, Logstash metrics should _not_ be routed to these nodes.
-Doing so can create resource contention and impact the stability of the
-Elasticsearch cluster. Therefore, do not include such nodes in
-`monitoring.elasticsearch.hosts`.
-
-`monitoring.elasticsearch.username` and `monitoring.elasticsearch.password`::
-
-If your {es} is protected with basic authentication, these settings provide the
-username and password that the Logstash instance uses to authenticate for
-shipping monitoring data.
-
-`monitoring.elasticsearch.proxy`::
-
-Optional setting that allows you to specify a proxy URL if Logstash needs to use a proxy
-to reach your Elasticsearch cluster.
-
-[[monitoring-collection-settings]]
-===== Monitoring collection settings
-
-`monitoring.collection.interval`::
-
-Controls how often data samples are collected and shipped on the Logstash side.
-Defaults to `10s`. If you modify the collection interval, set the 
-`monitoring.min_interval_seconds` option in `kibana.yml` to the same value.
-
-[[monitoring-cluster-uuid]]
-`monitoring.cluster_uuid`::
-
-The universally unique identifier (UUID) for the monitoring cluster. 
-By default, {ls} identifies and uses the `cluster uuid` value from each 
-elasticsearch output defined in the pipelines, and ignores this
-setting.
-+
-If no `cluster_uuid` is discovered in elasticsearch outputs, then {ls}
-uses this value to tag the data shipped to the monitoring cluster.
-
-[[monitoring-ssl-settings]]
-===== Monitoring TLS/SSL settings
-
-You can configure the following Transport Layer Security (TLS) or
-Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) settings. For more information, see 
-<<ls-monitoring-user>>.
-
-`monitoring.elasticsearch.ssl.certificate_authority`::
-
-Optional setting that enables you to specify a path to the `.pem` file for the
-certificate authority for your {es} instance.
-
-`monitoring.elasticsearch.ssl.truststore.path`::
-
-Optional settings that provide the paths to the Java keystore (JKS) to validate
-the server’s certificate.
-
-`monitoring.elasticsearch.ssl.truststore.password`::
-
-Optional settings that provide the password to the truststore.
-
-`monitoring.elasticsearch.ssl.keystore.path`::
-
-Optional settings that provide the paths to the Java keystore (JKS) to validate
-the client’s certificate.
-
-`monitoring.elasticsearch.ssl.keystore.password`::
-
-Optional settings that provide the password to the keystore.
-
-`monitoring.elasticsearch.ssl.verification_mode`::
-
-Option to validate the server’s certificate. Defaults to `certificate`. To
-disable, set to `none`. Disabling this severely compromises security.
-
-`monitoring.elasticsearch.sniffing`::
-
-Finds all {es} cluster nodes and adds them to the hosts list.
-Defaults to `false`.
-
-[[monitoring-additional-settings]]
-===== Additional settings
-
-`monitoring.elasticsearch.cloud_id`::
-
-If you're using {es} in {ecloud}, you should specify the identifier here.
-This setting is an alternative to `monitoring.elasticsearch.hosts`.
-If `cloud_id` is configured, `monitoring.elasticsearch.hosts` should not be used.
-The {es} instances that you want to ship your Logstash metrics to. This might be
-the same {es} instance specified in the `outputs` section in your Logstash
-configuration, or a different one.
-
-`monitoring.elasticsearch.cloud_auth`::
-
-If you're using {es} in {ecloud}, you can set your auth credentials here.
-This setting is an alternative to both `monitoring.elasticsearch.username`
-and `monitoring.elasticsearch.password`. If `cloud_auth` is configured,
-those settings should not be used.
