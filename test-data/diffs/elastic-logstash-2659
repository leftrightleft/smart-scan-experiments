+==== Benefits
+
+Some of the many benefits of having your plugin in the logstash-plugins
+repository are:
+
+* **Discovery** Your plugin will appear in the http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/en/logstash/current/index.html[Logstash Reference],
+where Logstash users look first for plugins and documentation.
+* **Documentation** Your plugin documentation will automatically be added to the
+ http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/en/logstash/current/index.html[Logstash Reference].
+* **Testing** With our testing infrastructure, your plugin will be continuously
+tested against current and future releases of Logstash.  As a result, users will
+have the assurance that if incompatibilities arise, they will be quickly
+discovered and corrected.

+==== Acceptance Guidelines
+
+* **Code Review** Your plugin must be reviewed by members of the community for
+coherence, quality, readability, stability and security.
+* **Tests** Your plugin must contain tests to be accepted.  These tests are also
+subject to code review for scope and completeness.  It's ok if you don't know
+how to write tests -- we will guide you. We are working on publishing a guide to
+creating tests for Logstash which will make it easier.  In the meantime, you can
+refer to http://betterspecs.org/ for examples.
