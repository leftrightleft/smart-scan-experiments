+=== Logstash 7.10.1 Release Notes
+
+==== Notable issues fixed
+
+===== Support recreation of same pipeline through centralized pipeline management
+When users attempted to delete and recreate a pipeline with the same identifier and configuration, Logstash was unable
+to pick up the new pipeline. https://github.com/elastic/logstash/issues/12387[#12387]
+
+==== Plugins
+
+*Azure_event_hubs Input - 1.2.3*
+
+* Fixed missing configuration of `prefetch_count` and `receive_timeout` https://github.com/logstash-plugins/logstash-input-azure_event_hubs/pull/61[#61]
+
+*Http Input - 3.3.6*
+
+* Fixes a regression introduced in **3.1.0** with the migration to the Netty back-end that broke
+browser-based workflows for some users. When a plugin that is configured to require Basic authentication receives a request that does not
+include authentication, it now appropriately includes an `WWW-Authenticate` header in its `401 Unauthorized` response,
+allowing the browser to collect credentials before retrying the request. https://github.com/logstash-plugins/logstash-input-http/pull/129[#129]
+
+*Sqs Input - 3.1.3*
+
+* Fix: retry networking errors (with backoff) https://github.com/logstash-plugins/logstash-input-sqs/pull/57[#57]
+
+*Kafka Integration - 10.5.3*
+
+* Fix: set (optional) truststore when endpoint id check disabled. Since **10.1.0** disabling server host-name
+verification (`ssl_endpoint_identification_algorithm => ""`) did not allow the (output) plugin to set
+`ssl_truststore_location => "..."` https://github.com/logstash-plugins/logstash-integration-kafka/pull/60[#60]
+* Docs: explain group_id in case of multiple inputs https://github.com/logstash-plugins/logstash-integration-kafka/pull/59[#59]
