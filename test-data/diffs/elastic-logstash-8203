 ==== Deployment Architecture
@@ -29,19 +24,89 @@ The Logstash ArcSight module understands CEF (Common Event Format), and can
 accept, enrich, and index these events for analysis on the Elastic Stack. ADP
 contains two core data collection components for data streaming:
 
+* The _Smart Connectors (SC)_ are edge log collectors that parse and normalize
+data to CEF prior to publishing to the Logstash receiver.
 * The _Event Broker (EB)_ is the central hub for incoming data and is based on
 open source Apache Kafka. The Logstash ArcSight module can consume directly from
 EB topics.

+===== Requirements
+
+* These instructions assume you have part of the Elastic Stack (Logstash, Elasticsearch,
+Kibana) already installed. The products you need are
+https://www.elastic.co/downloads[available to download] and easy to install. The
+Elastic Stack 5.6 or higher is required for this module.
+* The Elastic Stack is running locally with default ports exposed, namely
+Elasticsearch as “localhost:9200” and Kibana as “localhost:5601”. Note that you can also run 
+Elasticsearch, Kibana and Logstash on separate hosts to consume data from ArcSight.
+* Smart Connector has been configured to publish ArcSight data (to TCP port `5000`) using the CEF syslog 
+destination.

+bin/logstash --modules arcsight --setup
+  -M "arcsight.var.inputs=smartconnector"

+TIP: The command in this example is formatted for readability. Remove the line
+breaks before running this command.
+
+The `--modules arcsight` option spins up an ArcSight CEF-aware Logstash
+pipeline for ingestion. The `--setup` option creates an `arcsight-*` index
+pattern in Elasticsearch and imports Kibana dashboards and visualizations. On
+subsequent module runs or when scaling out the Logstash deployment,
+the `--setup` option should be omitted to avoid overwriting the existing Kibana
+dashboards.
