-  Contains options used by the `system-install` script in `/usr/share/logstash/bin` to build the appropriate startup
-  script for your system. When you install the Logstash package, the `system-install` script executes at the end of the
-  installation process and uses the settings specified in `startup.options` to set options such as the user, group,
-  service name, and service description. By default, Logstash services are installed under the user `logstash`. The `startup.options` file makes it easier for you to install multiple instances of the Logstash service. You can copy
-  the file and change the values for specific settings. Note that the `startup.options` file is not read at startup. If
-  you want to change the Logstash startup script (for example, to change the Logstash user or read from a different
-  configuration path), you must re-run the `system-install` script (as root) to pass in the new settings.
