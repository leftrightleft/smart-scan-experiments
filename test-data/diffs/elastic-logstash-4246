+## 2.1.0 (Nov 24, 2015)
+### general
+ - Added ability to install and upgrade Logstash plugins without requiring internet connectivity (#2376). 
+ - Support alternate or private Ruby gems server to install and update plugins (#3576).
+ - Added ability to reliably shutdown Logstash when there is a stall in event processing. This option 
+   can be enabled by passing `--allow-unsafe-shutdown` flag while starting Logstash. Please be aware that
+   any in-flight events will be lost when shutdown happens (#3451)
+ - Fixed a memory leak which could be triggered when events having a date were serialized to string (#4222).
+ - Added JDBC input to default package.
+ - Adding --debug to --configtest now shows the configuration in blocks annotated by source config file. Very
+   useful when using multiple config files in a directory. (#3243)
+ - Reset default worker threads to 1 when using non thread-safe filters like multiline (#4130).
+ - Fixed file permissions for the logrotate configuration file.
+ - Changed the default heap size from 500MB to 1GB (#3861)
+ - Fixed config check option when starting Logstash through init scripts (#3645)

+### output
+  Elasticsearch
+    - Improved the default template to use doc_values wherever possible.
+    - Improved the default template to disable fielddata on analyzed string fields.
+    - Added New setting: timeout. This lets you control the behavior of a slow/stuck request to Elasticsearch
+      that could be, for example, caused by network, firewall, or load balancer issues (#260).
