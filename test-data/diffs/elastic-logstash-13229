+===== Removed support for JAVA_HOME
+Support for using `JAVA_HOME` to override the path to the JDK that Logstash runs with has been removed for this release.
+In the `8.x` release, users should set the value of `LS_JAVA_HOME` to their preferred JDK path if they
+wish to use something other than the bundled JDK. The value of `JAVA_HOME` will be ignored.
