-**Mapping changes:** Users may have custom template changes, so by default a Logstash upgrade will

-
-There is one known issue (removal of https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/1.4/mapping-object-type.html#_path_3[path]) with using GeoIP filter that needs a manual update to the template.

-Note: If you have custom template changes, please make sure to save it and merge any changes. You can

-curl -XGET localhost:9200/_template/logstash
