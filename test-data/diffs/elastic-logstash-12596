+=== Logstash 7.11.0 Release Notes
+
+==== New features and enhancements
+
+===== Wildcard support in Central Pipeline Management
+
+With {logstash-ref}/configuring-centralized-pipelines.html[Central Pipeline
+Management], users can create {ls} pipelines in {kib}. Release 7.11.0 introduces
+wildcard support, providing users a more dynamic configuration process. Users no
+longer have to list all pipelines manually. Instead, Logstash will automatically
+pick up new pipelines that match the wildcard set in
+`xpack.management.pipeline.id`. 
+
+==== Performance improvements and notable issues fixed
+
+**Central Pipeline Management improvements**
+
+This release introduces a fix to a long-standing issue for Logstash Central
+Management in Kibana. When a user tried to delete a Logstash pipeline using
+Kibana, the pipeline wasnâ€™t deleted from the registry. The issue prevented users
+from creating a new pipeline with the same name and config string. The issue has
+been resolved in https://github.com/elastic/logstash/issues/12387[#12387].
+
+**Persistent Queue corruption after newly allocated page**
+
+A Logstash crash or forceful termination could leave the queue in an
+unrecoverable state, causing the following error to be logged as the pipeline
+starts:
+
+```
+[ERROR][org.logstash.execution.AbstractPipelineExt] Logstash failed to create queue.
+org.logstash.ackedqueue.io.MmapPageIOV2$PageIOInvalidVersionException: Expected page version=2 but found version=0
+```
+
+This has been resolved in https://github.com/elastic/logstash/pull/12554[#12554]
+by ensuring the version file is persisted.
+
+**Better handling of fatal exceptions**
+
+Under certain circumstances, Logstash would not respect fatal errors such as
+java.lang.OutOfMemoryError and would continue executing without processing data.
+This issue has been addressed in
+https://github.com/elastic/logstash/pull/12563[#12563]. As a consequence of this
+change, Logstash will now halt immediately with exit codes associated with the kind of
+fatal error:
+
+* 128 - InternalError (error in the Java Virtual Machine)
+* 127 - OutOfMemoryError
+* 126 - StackOverflowError
+* 125 - UnknownError (unknown error in the Java Virtual Machine)
+* 124 - IOError
+* 123 - LinkageError (related to JRuby/FFI)
+* 120 - any other Error type not covered by a specific error code
+
+==== Plugin releases
+
+*Elasticsearch Input - 4.9.0*
+
+* Added `target` option, allowing the hit's source to target a specific field instead of being expanded at the root of the event. This allows the input to play nicer with the Elastic Common Schema when the input does not follow the schema. https://github.com/logstash-plugins/logstash-input-elasticsearch/issues/117[#117]
+* [DOC] Fixed links to restructured Logstash-to-cloud docs https://github.com/logstash-plugins/logstash-input-elasticsearch/pull/139[#139]
+* [DOC] Document the permissions required in secured clusters https://github.com/logstash-plugins/logstash-input-elasticsearch/pull/137[#137]
+
+*Kafka Integration - 10.7.0*
+
+* Switched use from Faraday to Manticore as HTTP client library to access Schema Registry service to fix issue https://github.com/logstash-plugins/logstash-integration-kafka/pull/63[#63] 
+* Added functionality to Kafka input to use Avro deserializer in retrieving data from Kafka. The schema is retrieved from an instance of Confluent's Schema Registry service https://github.com/logstash-plugins/logstash-integration-kafka/pull/51[#51]
+     
+*Validator_support Mixin - 1.0.1*
+
+* Introduces plugin parameter validation adapters, including initial backport for `:field_reference` validator.
+
+*Elasticsearch Output - 10.8.1*
+
+* Fixed an issue when assigning the no-op license checker https://github.com/logstash-plugins/logstash-output-elasticsearch/pull/984[#984]
+* Refactored configuration options into specific and shared in PluginMixins namespace https://github.com/logstash-plugins/logstash-output-elasticsearch/pull/973[#973]
+* Refactored common methods into specific and shared in PluginMixins namespace https://github.com/logstash-plugins/logstash-output-elasticsearch/pull/976[#976]
