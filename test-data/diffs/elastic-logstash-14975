 Flow rates provide visibility into how a Logstash instance or an individual pipeline is _currently_ performing relative to _itself_ over time.
 This allows us to attach _meaning_ to the cumulative-value metrics that are also presented by this API, and to determine whether an instance or pipeline is behaving better or worse than it has in the past.

 This metric is expressed in worker-millis-spent-per-event (`duration_in_millis` / `events.in`) with higher scores indicating more resources spent per event.
 It is especially useful for identifying issues with plugins that operate on a small subset of events.
-An `"Infinity"` value for a given flow window indicates that worker millis have been spent without any events completing processing, and can indicate a plugin that is stuck.
+An `"Infinity"` value for a given flow window indicates that worker millis have been spent without any events completing processing; this can indicate a plugin that is either stuck or handling only empty batches.
