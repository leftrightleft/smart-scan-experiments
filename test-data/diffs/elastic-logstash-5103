 Every plugin should have a changelog (CHANGELOG.md).  If not, please create one.  When changes are made to a plugin, make sure to include a changelog entry under the respective version to document the change.  The changelog should be easily understood from a user point of view.  As we iterate and release plugins rapidly, users use the changelog as a mechanism for deciding whether to update.
 
-Changes that are not user facing should be tagged as “Internal: ”.  For example:
-
-* "Internal: Refactored specs for better testing"
-* "Default timeout configuration changed from 10s to 5s"
+Changes that are not user facing should be tagged as `internal:`.  For example:
+
+[source,markdown]
+ - internal: Refactored specs for better testing
+ - config: Default timeout configuration changed from 10s to 5s
+
+===== Detailed format of CHANGELOG.md

+Sharing a similar format of CHANGELOG.md in plugins ease readability for users.
