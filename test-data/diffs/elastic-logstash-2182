+1.5.0.beta1
+  # general
+  - Performance improvements: Logstash 1.5.0 is much faster -- we have improved the throughput 
+    of grok filter in some cases by 100%. In our benchmark testing, using only grok filter and
+    ingesting apache logs, throughput increased from 34K eps to 50K eps. 
+    JSON serialization/deserialization are now implemented using JrJackson library which 
+    improved performance significantly. Ingesting JSON events 1.3KB in size measured a throughput
+    increase from 16Keps to 30K eps. With events 45KB in size, throughput increased from 
+    850 eps to 3.5K eps
+  - Allow spaces in field references like [hello world] (#1513)
+  - Add Plugin manager functionality to Logstash which allows to install, delete and 
+    update Logstash plugins
+  - Remove ability to run multiple subcommands from bin/logstash like 
+    bin/logstash agent -f something.conf -- web (#1747)
+  - Fixed Logstash crashing on converting from ASCII to UTF-8. This was caused by charset
+    conversion issues in input codec (LOGSTASH-1789)
+  - Allow storing 'metadata' to an event which is not sent/encoded on output. This eliminates
+    the need for intermediate fields for example, while using date filter. (#1834)
+  - Accept file and http uri in -f command line option for specifying config files (#1873)
+  - Filters that generated events (multiline, clone, split, metrics) now propagate those events 
+    correctly to future conditionals (#1431)
+  - Bump Kibana version to 3.1.2
+  - Fixed file descriptor leaks when using HTTP. The fix prevents Logstash from stalling, and
+    in some cases crashing from out-of-memory errors (#1604, LOGSTASH-892)
+
+  # input
+  - Lumberjack: fixed Logstash crashes with Java Out Of Memory because of TCP 
+    thread leaks (#LOGSTASH-2168)
+  - TCP: fixed connection threads leak (#1509)
+  - Stdin: prevent overwrite of host field if already present in Event (#1668)
+  - S3: AWS credentials can be specfied through environment variables (#1619)
+  - Kafka: merge @joekiller's plugin to Logstash to get events from Kafka (#1472)
+  - RabbitMQ: fixed march_hare client uses incorrect connection url (LOGSTASH-2276)
+  - RabbitMQ: use Bunny 1.5.0+ (#1894)
+  - Twitter: added improvements, robustness, fixes. full_tweet option now works, we handle 
+    Twitter rate limiting errors (#1471)
+  - TCP: fixed input host field also contains source port (LOGSTASH-1849)
+  - Syslog: if input does not match syslog format, add tag _grokparsefailure_sysloginputplugin
+    which can be used to debug (#1593)
+
+  # filter
+  - Mutate: gsub evaluates variables like %{format} in the replacement text (#1529)
+  - Grok: "break_on_match => false" option now works correctly (#1547)
+  - Grok: allow user@hostname in commonapache log pattern (#1500 #1736)
+  - Grok: use optimized ruby-grok library which improves throughput in some cases by 50% (#1657)
+  - Date: fixed match defaults to 1970-01-01 when none of the formats matches and 
+    UNIX format is present in the list (#1236, LOGSTASH-1597)
+  - Mutate: fixed confusing error message for invalid type conversion (#1656, LOGSTASH-2003)
+  - Date: support parsing almost-ISO8601 patterns like 2001-11-06 20:45:45.123-0000 (without a T)
+    which does not match %{TIMESTAMP_ISO8601}
+  - KV: allows dynamic include/exclude keys. For example, if an event has a key field and the user 
+    wants to parse out a value using the kv filter, the user should be able to 
+    include_keys: [ "%{key}" ]
+  - DNS: fixed add_tag adds tags even if filter was unsuccessful (#1785)
+  - XML: fixed UndefinedConversionError with UTF-8 encoding (LOGSTASH-2246)
+  - Mutate: fixed nested field notation for convert option like 
+    'convert => [ "[a][0]", "float" ]' (#1401)
+
+  # output
+  - RabbitMQ: fixed crash while running Logstash for longer periods, typically when there's no
+    traffic on the logstash<->rabbitmq socket (LOGSTASH-1886)
+  - Statsd: fixed issue of converting very small float numbers to scientific notation 
+    like 9.3e-05 (#1670)
+  - Fixed undefined method error when conditional on an output (#LOGSTASH-2288)
+  - Elasticsearch output: Added support for multiple hosts in configuration and enhanced stability
+  - Elasticsearch output: Logstash will not create a message.raw field by default now. Message field 
+    is not_analyzed by Elasticsearch and adding a multi-field was essentially doubling the disk space
+    required, with no benefit
+  - Elasticsearch output: We have improved the security of the Elasticsearch output, input, and filter by
+    adding authentication and transport encryption support. In http protocol you can configure SSL/TLS to 
+    enable encryption and HTTP basic authentication to provide a username and password while making
+    requests (#1453)
+  - Kafka: merge @joekiller's plugin into Logstash to produce events to Kafka (#1472)
+  - File: Added enhancements and validations for destination path. Absolute path cannot start with a dynamic
+    string like /%{myfield}/, /test-%{myfield}/
+
 1.4.2 (June 24, 2014)
   # general
   - fixed path issues when invoking bin/logstash outside its home directory
