+=== Logstash 7.8.1 Release Notes
+
+==== Performance improvements and notable issues fixed
+
+===== Fixed performance regression during pipeline compilation
+
+A performance regression was introduced in 7.7.0, as described in the <<known-pipeline-slowdown,7.8.0 release notes>>.
+The issue was caused by an enhancement - https://github.com/elastic/logstash/pull/11078[#11078] - that included the plugin ids in log entries produced by Logstash pipelines.
+The implementation of this feature has been fixed and no longer causes the performance issue. You can find more about the solution here https://github.com/elastic/logstash/pull/12038[#12038].
+
+===== Multiple fixes to pipeline shutdown and reloading
+
+7.8.1 brings many fixes that improve the stability of the pipeline lifecycle.
+In previous releases, enabling monitoring could result in Logstash crashes if pipelines from concurrent pipeline reloads (fixed in https://github.com/elastic/logstash/pull/12034[#12034]).
+Also, pipelines failing to start correctly could prevent the Persistent Queue from being used afterwards (fixed in https://github.com/elastic/logstash/pull/12023[#12023]). Finally, a JRuby issue concerning threads and the Ruby/Java implementation boundary could cause crashes during pipeline reloads, and this has been fixed in https://github.com/elastic/logstash/pull/11900[#11900].
+
+===== Changes in the dependencies of Beats/TCP/HTTP Input Plugins
+
+To avoid breaking changes and retain control on the set of ciphers exposed in these plugins, underlying dependencies (`tcnative` and `boringssl`) have been dropped in favor of using JVM supplied ciphers instead.
+Overall there should be no impact but this may result in fewer ciphers being available if the JCE unlimited strength jurisdiction policy is not installed.
+NOTE: This policy is installed by default on versions of the JDK from u161 onwards.
+You can find more information in the release notes of the respective plugins.
