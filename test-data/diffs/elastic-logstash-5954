 respectively. Previously it used to install in `/opt` directory. This change was done to make the user experience 
 consistent with other Elastic products. Full directory layout is described in <<dir-layout>>.
 
+**Default Logging Level:** Changed the default log severity level to INFO instead of WARN to match Elasticsearch. Existing logs
+(in core and plugins) were too noisy at INFO level, so we had to audit log messages and switch some of them to DEBUG
+level.
+
+**Index Template:** The index template for 5.0 has been changed to reflect {ref}/breaking_50_mapping_changes.html[Elasticsearch's mapping changes]. Most
+importantly, the subfield for string multi-fields has changed from `.raw` to `.keyword` to match Elasticsearch's default
+behavior. The impact of this change to various user groups is detailed below:
+
+* New Logstash 5.0 and Elasticsearch 5.0 users - subfields use `.keyword` from the outset. In Kibana, you can use
+`field.keyword` to perform aggregations.
+* Existing users with custom templates - most of you won't be impacted because you use a custom template.
+* Existing users with default template - Logstash does not force you to upgrade templates if one already exists. If you
+intend to move to the new template and want to use `.keyword`, you'll have to reindex existing data. Elasticsearch's
+ {ref}/docs-reindex.html[reindexing API] can help move your data from using `.raw` subfields to `.keyword`.
+
 **Command Line Interface:** Most of the long form <<command-line-flags,options>> have been renamed 
 to adhere to the yml dot notation to be used in the settings file. Short form options have not been changed.

+=== Logstash 5.0-beta1 Release Notes
+
+* Migrated Logstash's internal logging framework to Log4j2. This enhancement provides the following features:
+** Support for changing the <<logging>> level dynamically at runtime through REST endpoints. New APIs have been exposed
+under `_node/logging` to update log levels. Also a new endpoint `_node/logging` was added to return all existing loggers.
+** Configurable file rotation policy for logs. The default is per-day.
+** Support for component-level or plugin-level log settings.
+** Unified logging across Logstash's Java and Ruby code.
+** Logs are now placed in the `LS_HOME/logs` directory, which is configurable via the `path.logs` setting.
+* Breaking Change: Changed the default log severity level to `INFO` instead of `WARN` to match Elasticsearch.
+* Show meaningful error messages for unknown CLI commands ({lsissue}5748[Issue 5748]).
+* Added monitoring API enhancements:
+** Added `duration_in_millis` metric under `/_node/stats/pipeline/events`.
+** Added JVM GC stats under `/_node/stats/jvm`.
+** Removed the `/_node/mem` resource because it's been properly moved under `/_node/jvm/mem`.
+** Added config reload stats under new resource type `_node/stats/pipeline/reloads`.
+** Added config reload enabled/disabled info to `/_node/pipeline`.
+** Added the JVM GC strategy info under `/_node/jvm`.
+** Fixed the `?human` option to work correctly for the `hot_threads` API.
+** Made sure a non-existing API endpoint correctly returns 404 and a structured error message.
+* Plugin Developers: Improved nomenclature and methods for 'threadsafe' outputs. Removed the `workers_not_supported` method ({lsissue}5662[Issue 5662]).
