+
+  Eclipse Public License - v 1.0
+
+  THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS ECLIPSE
+  PUBLIC LICENSE ("AGREEMENT"). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION
+  OF THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.
+
+  1. DEFINITIONS
+
+  "Contribution" means:
+
+      a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial code and
+         documentation distributed under this Agreement, and
+
+      b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:
+
+          i) changes to the Program, and
+
+          ii) additions to the Program;
+              where such changes and/or additions to the Program
+              originate from and are distributed by that particular
+              Contributor. A Contribution 'originates' from a
+              Contributor if it was added to the Program by such
+              Contributor itself or anyone acting on such
+              Contributor's behalf. Contributions do not include
+              additions to the Program which: (i) are separate modules
+              of software distributed in conjunction with the Program
+              under their own license agreement, and (ii) are not
+              derivative works of the Program.
+
+  "Contributor" means any person or entity that distributes the Program.
+
+  "Licensed Patents" mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor
+  which are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its
+  Contribution alone or when combined with the Program.
+
+  "Program" means the Contributions distributed in accordance with
+  this Agreement.
+
+  "Recipient" means anyone who receives the Program under this
+  Agreement, including all Contributors.
+
+  2. GRANT OF RIGHTS
+
+      a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor
+         hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide,
+         royalty-free copyright license to reproduce, prepare
+         derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform,
+         distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such
+         Contributor, if any, and such derivative works, in source
+         code and object code form.
+
+      b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor
+         hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide,
+         royalty-free patent license under Licensed Patents to make,
+         use, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise transfer the
+         Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in source code and
+         object code form. This patent license shall apply to the
+         combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at the
+         time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such
+         addition of the Contribution causes such combination to be
+         covered by the Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not
+         apply to any other combinations which include the
+         Contribution. No hardware per se is licensed hereunder.
+
+      c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants
+         the licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no
+         assurances are provided by any Contributor that the Program
+         does not infringe the patent or other intellectual property
+         rights of any other entity. Each Contributor disclaims any
+         liability to Recipient for claims brought by any other entity
+         based on infringement of intellectual property rights or
+         otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and
+         licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes
+         sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual property
+         rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party patent
+         license is required to allow Recipient to distribute the
+         Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that
+         license before distributing the Program.
+
+      d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has
+         sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to
+         grant the copyright license set forth in this Agreement.
+
+  3. REQUIREMENTS
+
+  A Contributor  may choose to  distribute the Program in  object code
+  form under its own license agreement, provided that:
+
+      a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and
+
+      b) its license agreement:
+
+          i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all
+             warranties and conditions, express and implied, including
+             warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement,
+             and implied warranties or conditions of merchantability
+             and fitness for a particular purpose;
+
+          ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all
+              liability for damages, including direct, indirect,
+              special, incidental and consequential damages, such as
+              lost profits;
+
+          iii) states that any provisions which differ from this
+               Agreement are offered by that Contributor alone and not
+               by any other party; and
+
+          iv) states that source code for the Program is available
+              from such Contributor, and informs licensees how to
+              obtain it in a reasonable manner on or through a medium
+              customarily used for software exchange.
+
+  When the Program is made available in source code form:
+
+      a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and
+
+      b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of
+         the Program.
+
+  Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained
+  within the Program.
+
+  Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its
+  Contribution, if any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent
+  Recipients to identify the originator of the Contribution.
+
+  4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION
+
+  Commercial distributors of software may accept certain
+  responsibilities with respect to end users, business partners and
+  the like. While this license is intended to facilitate the
+  commercial use of the Program, the Contributor who includes the
+  Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a manner
+  which does not create potential liability for other Contributors.
+  Therefore, if a Contributor includes the Program in a commercial
+  product offering, such Contributor ("Commercial Contributor") hereby
+  agrees to defend and indemnify every other Contributor ("Indemnified
+  Contributor") against any losses, damages and costs (collectively
+  "Losses") arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal actions
+  brought by a third party against the Indemnified Contributor to the
+  extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial
+  Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program in a
+  commercial product offering. The obligations in this section do not
+  apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged
+  intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an
+  Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial
+  Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial
+  Contributor to control, and cooperate with the Commercial
+  Contributor in, the defense and any related settlement negotiations.
+  The Indemnified Contributor may participate in any such claim at its
+  own expense.
+
+  For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial
+  product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial
+  Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance
+  claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance
+  claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's
+  responsibility alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor
+  would have to defend claims against the other Contributors related
+  to those performance claims and warranties, and if a court requires
+  any other Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial
+  Contributor must pay those damages.
+
+  5. NO WARRANTY
+
+  EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS
+  PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF
+  ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION,
+  ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT,
+  MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient
+  is solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using
+  and distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with
+  its exercise of rights under this Agreement , including but not
+  limited to the risks and costs of program errors, compliance with
+  applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs or equipment,
+  and unavailability or interruption of operations.
+
+  6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY
+
+  EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT
+  NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT,
+  INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES
+  (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON
+  ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR
+  TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF
+  THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS
+  GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
+  DAMAGES.
+
+  7. GENERAL
+
+  If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under
+  applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability
+  of the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further
+  action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to
+  the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and
+  enforceable.
+
+  If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity
+  (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that
+  the Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other
+  software or hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then
+  such Recipient's rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate
+  as of the date such litigation is filed.
+
+  All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it
+  fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this
+  Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of
+  time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's
+  rights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use
+  and distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable.
+  However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement and any
+  licenses granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue
+  and survive.
+
+  Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this
+  Agreement, but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is
+  copyrighted and may only be modified in the following manner. The
+  Agreement Steward reserves the right to publish new versions
+  (including revisions) of this Agreement from time to time. No one
+  other than the Agreement Steward has the right to modify this
+  Agreement. The Eclipse Foundation is the initial Agreement Steward.
+  The Eclipse Foundation may assign the responsibility to serve as the
+  Agreement Steward to a suitable separate entity. Each new version of
+  the Agreement will be given a distinguishing version number. The
+  Program (including Contributions) may always be distributed subject
+  to the version of the Agreement under which it was received. In
+  addition, after a new version of the Agreement is published,
+  Contributor may elect to distribute the Program (including its
+  Contributions) under the new version. Except as expressly stated in
+  Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no rights or
+  licenses to the intellectual property of any Contributor under this
+  Agreement, whether expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise.
+  All rights in the Program not expressly granted under this Agreement
+  are reserved.
+
+  This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and
+  the intellectual property laws of the United States of America. No
+  party to this Agreement will bring a legal action under this
+  Agreement more than one year after the cause of action arose. Each
+  party waives its rights to a jury trial in any resulting litigation.
