 readme we're going to describe it's features and the the necessary steps you will need to
 follow to setup your environment.
 
-### Environment setup
+### Environment setup and Running Tests
 
 This test are based on a collection of Vagrant defined VM's where the
 different test are going to be executed, so first setup necessary is to
 have vagrant properly available, see https://www.vagrantup.com/ for
 details on how to install it.
 
-After you get vagrant installed, you will need to perform the next
-setups:
-
-* Cd into the acceptance directory
-* run the command `vagrant up`, this will provision all the machines
-  defined in the Vagrantfile (located in this directory).
-
-An alternative way would to run the task `rake test:setup` what will do
-basically the same.
-
-When this process is done your test can be executed, to do that you will
-need to:
-
 _Inside the `qa` directory_
 
 * Execute the command `bundle` this will pull the necessary dependencies in your environment.
+* start your machines with `bundle exec test:setup`
 * Run `rake test:ssh_config` to dump the ssh configuration to access the different vagrant machines, this will generate a file named `.vm_ssh_config` that is going to be used for the tests.
 * Run `bundle exec rake test:acceptance:all` to run all acceptance test
   at once, there is also detailed tasks for platforms:
