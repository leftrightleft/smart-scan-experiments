+=== Logstash 7.9.2 Release Notes
+
+==== Notable issues fixed
+
+===== Secret store thread safety issues with multiple pipelines
+
+Since `7.8.0`, a change to optimise the speed of loading variables from the Logstash Secret Store could cause Logstash not to be able to start when the feature was used in conjunction with multiple pipelines. This has now been fixed, and you can read the details here: https://github.com/elastic/logstash/pull/12236[#12236]
+
+===== App Search output startup failure
+
+Since `7.9.0`, a regression was introduced which prevented pipelines using the Elastic App Search output from starting. This release fixes support for this plugin, you can read the details here: https://github.com/logstash-plugins/logstash-output-elastic_app_search/pull/18[#18], https://github.com/elastic/logstash/pull/12251[#12251]
