 ===== Logstash ArcSight Module Configuration Options
 
-These are the configurable settings available for the Logstash ArcSight module.
-When overriding settings in the command line, the setting option must be
-prefixed with the module name, i.e. `arcsight.var.inputs` instead of `var.inputs`.
+The ArcSight module provides the following settings for configuring the behavior
+of the module. These settings include ArcSight-specific options plus common
+options that are supported by all Logstash modules. 
 
-All settings are optional. If you don't specify configuration settings, Logstash
-uses the defaults.
+When you override a setting at the command line, remember to prefix the setting
+with the module name, for example, `arcsight.var.inputs` instead of `var.inputs`.
