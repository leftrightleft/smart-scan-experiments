+=== Ruby Filter Breaking Changes
+
+With the migration to the Java Event (https://github.com/elastic/logstash/issues/4191[Issue 4191]), we have changed 
+how you can access internal data. The Event object no longer returns a reference to the data. Instead, it returns a
+copy. This might change how you do manipulation of your data, especially when working with nested hashes.
+When working with nested hashes, it’s recommended that you use the `fieldref` syntax instead of using multiple brackets.
+
+**Examples:**
+[source, js]
+----------------------------------
+filter { 
+  ruby {
+    codec => "event['uuid'] = event['uuid'].gsub(/b/, '')" # instead of using event['uuid'].gsub!(/b/, '')

-== Logstash 2.2 Release Notes
-
-* This release of Logstash includes support for offline plugin installation from storage media.
-* The `jruby-openssl` library version is now 0.9.13
-* The <<plugin-filters-multiline,multiline filter plugin>> is deprecated in favor of the multiline codec plugin. Support 
-for the multiline filter plugin will be removed completely in a future release of Logstash.
-* The `http_poller` plugin is now installed by default.
+== Logstash 2.3 Release Notes
+
+* Added dynamic config, a new feature to track config file for changes and restart the 
+  pipeline (same process) with updated config changes. This feature can be enabled in two 
+  ways: Passing a CLI long-form option `--auto-reload` or with short-form `-r`. Another 
+  option, `--reload-interval <seconds>` controls how often LS should check the config files 
+  for changes. Alternatively, if you don't start with the CLI option, you can send SIGHUP 
+  or `kill -1` signal to LS to reload the config file, and restart the pipeline ({lsissue}4513[Issue 4513]).
+* Added support to evaluate environment variables inside the Logstash config. You can also specify a 
+  default if the variable is not defined. The syntax is `${myVar:default}` ({lsissue}3944[Issue 3944]).
+* Improved throughput performance across the board (up by 2x in some configs) by implementing Event 
+  representation in Java. Event is the main object that encapsulates data as it flows through 
+  Logstash and provides APIs for the plugins to perform processing. This change also enables 
+  faster serialization for future persistence work ({lsissue}4191[Issue 4191]).
+* Added ability to configure custom garbage collection log file using `$LS_LOG_DIR`.
+* Deprecated `bin/plugin` in favor of `bin/logstash-plugin`. In the next major version `bin/plugin` will 
+  be removed to prevent `PATH` being polluted when other components of the Elastic stack are installed on 
+  the same instance ({lsissue}4891[Issue 4891]).
+* Fixed a bug where new pipeline might break plugins by calling the `register` method twice causing 
+  undesired behavior ({lsissue}4851[Issue 4851])).
+* Made `JAVA_OPTS` and `LS_JAVA_OPTS` work consistently on Windows ({lsissue}4758[Issue 4758]).
+* Fixed bug where specifying JMX parameters in `LS_JAVA_OPTS` caused Logstash not to restart properly
+  ({lsissue}4319[Issue 4319]).
+* Fixed a bug where upgrading plugins with Manticore threw an error and sometimes corrupted installation ({lsissue}4818[Issue 4818]).
+* Removed milestone warning that was displayed when the `--pluginpath` option was used to load plugins ({lsissue}4562[Issue 4562]).
+* Upgraded to JRuby 1.7.24.
+* Reverted default output workers to 1. Previously we had made output workers the same as number of pipeline workers (#4877).

-== General
+== Input Plugins
 
-* {lsissue}3693[Issue 3693]: The pipeline has been substantially reëngineered, adding new <<command-line-flags,command 
-line flags>>. Filter and output stages are now a single stage that consumes messages from an in-memory queue. This change 
-* {lsissue}4291[Issue 4291]: Logstash can be launched from a symbolic link.
-* {lsissue}4321[Issue 4321]: Fixes an issue with the `--configtest` switch and the SysV init script.

+* Enhanced to verify client certificates against CA (https://github.com/logstash-plugins/logstash-input-beats/issues/8[Issue 8]).
+
+*'RabbitMQ`*:
 
-*`file`*:
-* https://github.com/logstash-plugins/logstash-input-file/issues/81[Issue 81]: Adds the `close_older` configuration option 
-to close files that remain unmodified for longer than the specified timespan in seconds.
-* https://github.com/logstash-plugins/logstash-input-file/issues/81[Issue 81]: Adds the `ignore_older` configuration 
-option to ignore the contents of files that have remained unmodified for longer than the specified timespan in seconds.
+* Breaking Change: Metadata is now disabled by default because it was regressing performance.
+* Improved performance by using an internal queue and bulk ACKs.
 
-*'jdbc`*:
-* https://github.com/logstash-plugins/logstash-input-jdbc/issues/57[Issue 57]: Allows tracking by a column value rather 
-than by last run time. This is a breaking change, as users may be required to change from using `sql_last_start` to use 
-`sql_last_value` in their queries. Time-based queries require no other changes.
-* https://github.com/logstash-plugins/logstash-input-jdbc/issues/44[Issue 44]: Adds an option to control lowercasing of
-column names.
+*`Redis`*:
 
-*`beats`*:
-* https://github.com/logstash-plugins/logstash-input-beats/issues/14[Issue 14]: Refactored beats input to fix thread 
-synchronization issues under high data volume.
+* Increased the batch_size to 100 by default. This provides a big jump in throughput and 
+  reduction in CPU utilization (https://github.com/logstash-plugins/logstash-input-redis/issues/25[Issue 25])
 
-*`kafka`*:
-* https://github.com/logstash-plugins/logstash-input-kafka/issues/59[Issue 59]: Fixes a CPU load issue when no new
-messages are available in the Kafka broker.
+*`JDBC`*:

-*`date`*:

-`sprintf` format.
-* https://github.com/logstash-plugins/logstash-filter-date/issues/33[Issue 33]: Improves handling for new year rollovers 
-when the year is not present in the time format. When the local timestamp is December and the event time is January, the 
-year is set to the following year. When the local time is January and the event time is December, the year is set to the 
-previous year.
+* Improved performance by adding caches to both successful and failed requests.
+* Added support for retrying with the `:max_retries` setting.
+* Lowered the default value of timeout from 2 to 0.5 seconds.

 == Output Plugins
 
-*`elasticsearch`*:
-* https://github.com/elastic/logstash/issues/4433[Issue 4433]: Node protocol is now discouraged and will not be actively

-* https://github.com/logstash-plugins/logstash-output-elasticsearch/issues/321[Issue 321]: Changes retry behavior. "Too 
-busy" and "service unavailable" errors from ES are retried indefinitely. Conflict errors are neve retried.
+*`Elasticsearch`*:
 
-*`file`*:
-* https://github.com/logstash-plugins/logstash-output-file/issues/18[Issue 18] Adds configuration setting to set directory
-and file permission.
+* Bumped minimum manticore version to 0.5.4 which fixes a memory leak when sniffing 
+  is used (https://github.com/logstash-plugins/logstash-output-elasticsearch/issues/392[Issue 392]).
+* Fixed bug when updating documents with doc_as_upsert and scripting.   
+* Made error messages more verbose and easier to parse by humans.
+* Retryable failures are now logged at the info level instead of warning.
 
-[float]
-== Codec Plugins
 
-*`multiline`*:
-* https://github.com/logstash-plugins/logstash-codec-multiline/pull/18[Issue 18]: Adds the `auto_flush` configuration 
-option, with no default. Auto flushes are not performed if the value of `auto_flush` is not `true`. This feature flushes 
-events buffered as part of a multiline event when used with the `file` input plugin, for example.
