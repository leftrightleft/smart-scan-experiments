+==== Potential compatibility issue between TLS v1.3 and some Java 11 versions
+
+Bugs in some JDK versions can prevent {ls} from successfully conducting a TLS
+v1.3 handshake. This issue affects {ls} instances using both:
+
+* JDK 11.0.0 - 11.0.4, and
+* TLS v1.3 in plugins (such as Elasticsearch output, Beats input, TCP input) and/or
+central management/monitoring. Note that some plugins use TLS v1.3 by default.
+
+If you encounter this issue, we recommend upgrading to JDK 11.0.5 or later. 
+If you cannot upgrade your JDK, try using and enforcing TLS v1.2.
