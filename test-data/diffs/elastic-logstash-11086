+
+   1. Definitions.

+
+      "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
+      exercising permissions granted by this License.
+
+      "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
+      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
+      source, and configuration files.
+
+      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
+      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
+      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
+      and conversions to other media types.
+
+      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
+      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
+      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
+      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
+
+      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
+      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
+      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
+      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
+      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
+      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
+      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
+
+      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
+      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
+      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
+      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
+      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
+      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
+      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
+      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
+      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
+      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
+      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
+      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
+      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
+
+      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
+      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
+      subsequently incorporated within the Work.
+
+   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
+      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
+      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
+      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
+      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
+      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
+
+   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
+      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
+      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
+      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
+      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
+      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
+      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
+      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
+      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
+      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
+      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
+      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
+      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
+      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
+      as of the date such litigation is filed.
+
+   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
+      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
+      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
+      meet the following conditions:
+
+      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
+          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
+
+      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
+          stating that You changed the files; and
+
+      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
+          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
+          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
+          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
+          the Derivative Works; and
+
+      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
+          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
+          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
+          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
+          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
+          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
+          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
+          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
+          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
+          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
+          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
+          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
+          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
+          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
+          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
+          as modifying the License.
+
+      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
+      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
+      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
+      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
+      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
+      the conditions stated in this License.
+
+   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
+      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
+      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
+      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
+      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
+      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
+      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
+
+   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
+      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
+      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
+      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
+
+   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
+      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
+      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
+      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
+      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
+      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
+      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
+      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
+      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
+
+   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
+      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
+      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
+      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
+      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
+      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
+      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
+      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
+      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
+      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
+      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
+
+   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
+      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
+      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
+      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
+      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
+      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
+      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
+      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
+      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
+      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
+
+   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

The simplest explanation of the licensing terms is that you can do whatever you want with the product and source code as long as you don't claim you wrote it or sue us. You should give it a read though, it's only half a page.

+
+   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION
+
+   1. Definitions.
+
+      "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
+      and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.
+
+      "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
+      the copyright owner that is granting the License.
+
+      "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
+      other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
+      control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
+      "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
+      direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
+      otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
+      outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.
+
+      "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
+      exercising permissions granted by this License.
+
+      "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
+      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
+      source, and configuration files.
+
+      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
+      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
+      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
+      and conversions to other media types.
+
+      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
+      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
+      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
+      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
+
+      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
+      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
+      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
+      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
+      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
+      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
+      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
+
+      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
+      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
+      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
+      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
+      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
+      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
+      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
+      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
+      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
+      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
+      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
+      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
+      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
+
+      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
+      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
+      subsequently incorporated within the Work.
+
+   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
+      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
+      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
+      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
+      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
+      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
+
+   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
+      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
+      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
+      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
+      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
+      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
+      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
+      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
+      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
+      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
+      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
+      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
+      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
+      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
+      as of the date such litigation is filed.
+
+   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
+      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
+      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
+      meet the following conditions:
+
+      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
+          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
+
+      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
+          stating that You changed the files; and
+
+      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
+          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
+          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
+          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
+          the Derivative Works; and
+
+      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
+          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
+          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
+          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
+          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
+          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
+          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
+          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
+          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
+          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
+          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
+          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
+          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
+          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
+          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
+          as modifying the License.
+
+      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
+      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
+      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
+      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
+      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
+      the conditions stated in this License.
+
+   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
+      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
+      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
+      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
+      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
+      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
+      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
+
+   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
+      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
+      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
+      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
+
+   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
+      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
+      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
+      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
+      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
+      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
+      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
+      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
+      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
+
+   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
+      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
+      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
+      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
+      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
+      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
+      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
+      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
+      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
+      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
+      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
+
+   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
+      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
+      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
+      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
+      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
+      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
+      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
+      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
+      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
+      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
+
+   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
+
+   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.
+
+      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following
+      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "[]"
+      replaced with your own identifying information. (Don't include
+      the brackets!)  The text should be enclosed in the appropriate
+      comment syntax for the file format. We also recommend that a
+      file or class name and description of purpose be included on the
+      same "printed page" as the copyright notice for easier
+      identification within third-party archives.

+    Work; and 
+    (b) under Patents Claims infringed by the making, using or selling 
+    of Original Code, to make, have made, use, practice, sell, and offer for 
+    sale, and/or otherwise dispose of the Original Code (or portions thereof). 
+    
+      (c) the licenses granted in this Section 2.1(a) and (b) 
+    are effective on the date Initial Developer first distributes Original Code 
+    under the terms of this License. 
+    (d) Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is 
+    granted: 1) for code that You delete from the Original Code; 2) separate 
+    from the Original Code;  or 3) for infringements caused by: i) the 
+    modification of the Original Code or ii) the combination of the Original 
+    Code with other software or devices.  2.2. Contributor 
+  Grant. Subject to third party intellectual property claims, each 
+  Contributor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive 
+  license

+    modify, display, perform, sublicense and distribute the Modifications 
+    created by such Contributor (or portions thereof) either on an unmodified 
+    basis, with other Modifications, as Covered Code and/or as part of a Larger 
+    Work; and 
+    (b) under Patent Claims infringed by the making, using, or selling 
+    of  Modifications made by that Contributor either alone and/or in combination with its Contributor Version (or portions of such 
+    combination), to make, use, sell, offer for sale, have made, and/or 
+    otherwise dispose of: 1) Modifications made by that Contributor (or portions 
+    thereof); and 2) the combination of  Modifications made by that 
+    Contributor with its Contributor Version (or portions of such 
+    combination). 
+    (c) the licenses granted in Sections 2.2(a) and 2.2(b) are 
+    effective on the date Contributor first makes Commercial Use of the Covered 
+    Code. 
+    (d)    Notwithstanding Section 2.2(b) above, no 
+    patent license is granted: 1) for any code that Contributor has deleted from 
+    the Contributor Version; 2)  separate from the Contributor 
+    Version;  3)  for infringements caused by: i) third party 
+    modifications of Contributor Version or ii)  the combination of 
+    Modifications made by that Contributor with other software  (except as 
+    part of the Contributor Version) or other devices; or 4) under Patent Claims 
+    infringed by Covered Code in the absence of Modifications made by that 
+    Contributor.
+3. Distribution Obligations. 
+3.1. Application of License. The Modifications which You create 
+  or to which You contribute are governed by the terms of this License, 
+  including without limitation Section 2.2. The Source Code version of 
+  Covered Code may be distributed only under the terms of this License or a 
+  future version of this License released under Section 6.1, and You must 
+  include a copy of this License with every copy of the Source Code You 
+  distribute. You may not offer or impose any terms on any Source Code version 
+  that alters or restricts the applicable version of this License or the 
+  recipients' rights hereunder. However, You may include an additional document 
+  offering the additional rights described in Section 3.5. 
+  3.2. Availability of Source Code. Any Modification which You 
+  create or to which You contribute must be made available in Source Code form 
+  under the terms of this License either on the same media as an Executable 
+  version or via an accepted Electronic Distribution Mechanism to anyone to whom 
+  you made an Executable version available; and if made available via Electronic 
+  Distribution Mechanism, must remain available for at least twelve (12) months 
+  after the date it initially became available, or at least six (6) months after 
+  a subsequent version of that particular Modification has been made available 
+  to such recipients. You are responsible for ensuring that the Source Code 
+  version remains available even if the Electronic Distribution Mechanism is 
+  maintained by a third party. 
+  3.3. Description of Modifications. You must cause all Covered 
+  Code to which You contribute to contain a file documenting the changes You 
+  made to create that Covered Code and the date of any change. You must include 
+  a prominent statement that the Modification is derived, directly or 
+  indirectly, from Original Code provided by the Initial Developer and including 
+  the name of the Initial Developer in (a) the Source Code, and (b) in any 
+  notice in an Executable version or related documentation in which You describe 
+  the origin or ownership of the Covered Code. 
+  3.4. Intellectual Property Matters 
+  (a) Third Party Claims. If Contributor has knowledge that a 
+    license under a third party's intellectual property rights is required to 
+    exercise the rights granted by such Contributor under Sections 2.1 or 2.2, 
+    Contributor must include a text file with the Source Code distribution 
+    titled "LEGAL'' which describes the claim and the party making the claim in 
+    sufficient detail that a recipient will know whom to contact. If Contributor 
+    obtains such knowledge after the Modification is made available as described 
+    in Section 3.2, Contributor shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in all 
+    copies Contributor makes available thereafter and shall take other steps 
+    (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably 
+    calculated to inform those who received the Covered Code that new knowledge 
+    has been obtained. 
+    (b) Contributor APIs. If Contributor's Modifications include 
+    an application programming interface and Contributor has knowledge of patent 
+    licenses which are reasonably necessary to implement that API, Contributor 
+    must also include this information in the LEGAL file. 
+             
+  (c)    Representations. 
+  Contributor represents that, except as disclosed pursuant to Section 
+    3.4(a) above, Contributor believes that Contributor's Modifications are 
+    Contributor's original creation(s) and/or Contributor has sufficient rights 
+    to grant the rights conveyed by this License.
+  3.5. Required Notices. You must duplicate the notice in 
+  Exhibit A in each file of the Source Code.  If it is not possible 
+  to put such notice in a particular Source Code file due to its structure, then 
+  You must include such notice in a location (such as a relevant directory) 
+  where a user would be likely to look for such a notice.  If You created 
+  one or more Modification(s) You may add your name as a Contributor to the 
+  notice described in Exhibit A.  You must also duplicate this 
+  License in any documentation for the Source Code where You describe 
+  recipients' rights or ownership rights relating to Covered Code.  You may 
+  choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or 
+  liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Code. However, You 
+  may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial Developer 
+  or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear than any such warranty, 
+  support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You 
+  hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any 
+  liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of 
+  warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer. 
+  3.6. Distribution of Executable Versions. You may distribute 
+  Covered Code in Executable form only if the requirements of Section 
+  3.1-3.5 have been met for that Covered Code, and if You include a 
+  notice stating that the Source Code version of the Covered Code is available 
+  under the terms of this License, including a description of how and where You 
+  have fulfilled the obligations of Section 3.2. The notice must be 
+  conspicuously included in any notice in an Executable version, related 
+  documentation or collateral in which You describe recipients' rights relating 
+  to the Covered Code. You may distribute the Executable version of Covered Code 
+  or ownership rights under a license of Your choice, which may contain terms 
+  different from this License, provided that You are in compliance with the 
+  terms of this License and that the license for the Executable version does not 
+  attempt to limit or alter the recipient's rights in the Source Code version 
+  from the rights set forth in this License. If You distribute the Executable 
+  version under a different license You must make it absolutely clear that any 
+  terms which differ from this License are offered by You alone, not by the 
+  Initial Developer or any Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the 
+  Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the 
+  Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such terms You offer. 
+
+  3.7. Larger Works. You may create a Larger Work by combining 
+  Covered Code with other code not governed by the terms of this License and 
+  distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make 
+  sure the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered 
+Code.4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation. 
+If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this 
+  License with respect to some or all of the Covered Code due to statute, 
+  judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this 
+  License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and 
+  the code they affect. Such description must be included in the LEGAL file 
+  described in Section 3.4 and must be included with all distributions of 
+  the Source Code. Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation, 
+  such description must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary 
+  skill to be able to understand it.5. Application of this License. 
+This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has attached 
+  the notice in Exhibit A and to related Covered Code.6. Versions 
+of the License. 
+6.1. New Versions. Netscape Communications Corporation 
+  (''Netscape'') may publish revised and/or new versions of the License from 
+  time to time. Each version will be given a distinguishing version number. 
+  6.2. Effect of New Versions. Once Covered Code has been 
+  published under a particular version of the License, You may always continue 
+  to use it under the terms of that version. You may also choose to use such 
+  Covered Code under the terms of any subsequent version of the License 
+  published by Netscape. No one other than Netscape has the right to modify the 
+  terms applicable to Covered Code created under this License. 
+  6.3. Derivative Works. If You create or use a modified version 
+  of this License (which you may only do in order to apply it to code which is 
+  not already Covered Code governed by this License), You must (a) rename Your 
+  license so that the phrases ''Mozilla'', ''MOZILLAPL'', ''MOZPL'', 
+  ''Netscape'', "MPL", ''NPL'' or any confusingly similar phrase do not appear 
+  in your license (except to note that your license differs from this License) 
+  and (b) otherwise make it clear that Your version of the license contains 
+  terms which differ from the Mozilla Public License and Netscape Public 
+  License. (Filling in the name of the Initial Developer, Original Code or 
+  Contributor in the notice described in Exhibit A shall not of 
+  themselves be deemed to be modifications of this License.)7.

+  DISCLAIMER.8. TERMINATION. 
+8.1.  This License and the rights granted hereunder will 
+  terminate automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to 
+  cure such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. All 
+  sublicenses to the Covered Code which are properly granted shall survive any 
+  termination of this License. Provisions which, by their nature, must remain in 
+  effect beyond the termination of this License shall survive. 
+  8.2.  If You initiate litigation by asserting a patent 
+  infringement claim (excluding declatory judgment actions) against Initial 
+  Developer or a Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against whom 
+  You file such action is referred to as "Participant")  alleging that: 
+  (a)  such Participant's Contributor Version directly or 
+  indirectly infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted by such 
+  Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License shall, upon 
+  60 days notice from Participant terminate prospectively, unless if within 60 
+  days after receipt of notice You either: (i)  agree in writing to pay 
+  Participant a mutually agreeable reasonable royalty for Your past and future 
+  use of Modifications made by such Participant, or (ii) withdraw Your 
+  litigation claim with respect to the Contributor Version against such 
+  Participant.  If within 60 days of notice, a reasonable royalty and 
+  payment arrangement are not mutually agreed upon in writing by the parties or 
+  the litigation claim is not withdrawn, the rights granted by Participant to 
+  You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 automatically terminate at the expiration of 
+  the 60 day notice period specified above. 
+  (b)  any software, hardware, or device, other than such 
+  Participant's Contributor Version, directly or indirectly infringes any 
+  patent, then any rights granted to You by such Participant under Sections 
+  2.1(b) and 2.2(b) are revoked effective as of the date You first made, used, 
+  sold, distributed, or had made, Modifications made by that Participant. 
+  8.3.  If You assert a patent infringement claim against 
+  Participant alleging that such Participant's Contributor Version directly or 
+  indirectly infringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such as by 
+  license or settlement) prior to the initiation of patent infringement 
+  litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses granted by such 
+  Participant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken into account in 
+  determining the amount or value of any payment or license. 
+  8.4.  In the event of termination under Sections 8.1 or 8.2 
+  above,  all end user license agreements (excluding distributors and 
+  resellers) which have been validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder 
+  prior to termination shall survive termination.9. LIMITATION OF 
+LIABILITY. 
+UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING 
+  NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY 
+  OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED CODE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY 
+  OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, 
+  INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT 
+  LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR 
+  MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH 
+  PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS 
+  LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL 
+  INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW 
+  PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR 
+  LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND 
+  LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.10. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS. 
+The Covered Code is a ''commercial item,'' as that term is defined in 48 
+  C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of ''commercial computer software'' and 
+  ''commercial computer software documentation,'' as such terms are used in 48 
+  C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 
+  227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S. Government End Users 
+  acquire Covered Code with only those rights set forth herein.11. 
+MISCELLANEOUS. 
+This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject matter 
+  hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such 
+  provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it 
+  enforceable. This License shall be governed by California law provisions 
+  (except to the extent applicable law, if any, provides otherwise), excluding 
+  its conflict-of-law provisions. With respect to disputes in which at least one 
+  party is a citizen of, or an entity chartered or registered to do business in 
+  the United States of America, any litigation relating to this License shall be 
+  subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Courts of the Northern District of 
+  California, with venue lying in Santa Clara County, California, with the 
+  losing party responsible for costs, including without limitation, court costs 
+  and reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses. The application of the United 
+  Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is 
+  expressly excluded. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of 
+  a contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not apply to this 
+  License.12. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS. 
+As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is 
+  responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly, out of its 
+  utilization of rights under this License and You agree to work with Initial 
+  Developer and Contributors to distribute such responsibility on an equitable 
+  basis. Nothing herein is intended or shall be deemed to constitute any 
+  admission of liability.13. MULTIPLE-LICENSED CODE. 
+Initial Developer may designate portions of the Covered Code as 
+  "Multiple-Licensed".  "Multiple-Licensed" means that the Initial 
+  Developer permits you to utilize portions of the Covered Code under Your 
+  choice of the MPL or the alternative licenses, if any, specified by the 
+  Initial Developer in the file described in Exhibit A.
+EXHIBIT A -Mozilla Public License.

+
+   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION

+      source, and configuration files.
+
+      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
+      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
+      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
+      and conversions to other media types.
+
+      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
+      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
+      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
+      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
+
+      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
+      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
+      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
+      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
+      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
+      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
+      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
+
+      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
+      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
+      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
+      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner

+      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
+
+      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
+      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
+      subsequently incorporated within the Work.
+
+   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
+      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
+      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
+      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
+      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
+      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
+
+   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
+      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
+      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
+      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
+      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,

+      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
+      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
+      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
+      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
+      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
+      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
+      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
+      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
+      as of the date such litigation is filed.
+
+   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
+      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
+      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
+      meet the following conditions:
+
+      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
+          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
+
+      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
+          stating that You changed the files; and
+
+      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
+          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
+          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
+          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
+          the Derivative Works; and
+
+      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
+          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
+          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
+          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
+          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
+          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
+          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
+          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
+          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
+          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
+          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
+          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
+          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
+          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
+          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
+          as modifying the License.
+
+      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
+      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
+      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
+      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
+      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
+      the conditions stated in this License.

+   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
+      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
+      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
+      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
+      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
+      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
+      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
+
+   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
+      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
+      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
+      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
+
+   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
+      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
+      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
+      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
+      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
+      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
+      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
+      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
+      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
+
+   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
+      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
+      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
+      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
+      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
+      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
+      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
+      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
+      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
+      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
+      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
+
+   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
+      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
+      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
+      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
+      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
+      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
+      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
+      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
+      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
+      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
