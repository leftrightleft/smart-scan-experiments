-[[beta1]]
-=== Logstash 5.0-beta1 Release Notes
+==== General
 
-* Migrated Logstash's internal logging framework to Log4j2. This enhancement provides the following features:
+* A new monitoring feature provides runtime visibility into the Logstash pipeline and its plugins. This component 
+collects various kinds of operational metrics while Logstash processes your data, and all of this information 
+can be queried using simple APIs. Please refer to <<monitoring>> for details.
+* Improved throughput performance across the board (up by 2x in some configs) by implementing Event 
+representation in Java. Event is the main object that encapsulates data as it flows through 
+Logstash and provides APIs for the plugins to perform processing. This change also enables 
+faster serialization for future persistence work ({lsissue}4191[Issue 4191]).
+* Breaking Change: Renamed filenames for Debian and RPM artifacts to match Elasticsearch's naming scheme. The metadata is 
+still the same, so upgrades will not be affected. Please refer to the new <<deb-layout, directory structure>>. If you have 
+automated downloads for Logstash, please make sure you use the updated URLs ({lsissue}5100[Issue 5100]).
+* Introduced a new way to configure application settings for Logstash through a `logstash.yml` file. This
+file is typically located in `LS_HOME/config` or `/etc/logstash` when installed via packages. Logstash will
+not be able to start without this file, so please make sure to pass in `path.settings` if you are starting
+Logstash manually after installing it via a package (RPM or DEB) ({lsissue}4401[Issue 4401]).
+* Breaking Change: Most of the long form CLI options have been renamed to match the settings defined in `logstash.yml`.
+* Breaking Change: For plugin developers, the Event class has a new API to access its data. You will no longer be able to
+directly use the Event class through the Ruby hash paradigm. All the plugins packaged with Logstash have
+been updated to use the new API, and their versions have been bumped to the next major. Please refer to <<event-api>> for details ({lsissue}5141[Issue 5141]).
+* Breaking Change: Environment variables inside the Logstash config are evaluated by default. There is no need to specify the
+`--allow-env` feature flag.
+* Breaking Change: Renamed `bin/plugin` to `bin/logstash-plugin`. This is to prevent `PATH` being polluted when other 
+components of the Elastic Stack are installed on the same instance ({lsissue}4891[Issue 4891]).
+* Added support for `DEBUG=1` when running any plugin-related commands. This option gives more information that is useful when debugging 
+unexpected behavior in `bin/logstash-plugin`
+* Logging Changes: Migrated Logstash's internal logging framework to Log4j2. This enhancement provides the following features:
 ** Support for changing the <<logging>> level dynamically at runtime through REST endpoints. New APIs have been exposed
-under `_node/logging` to update log levels. Also a new endpoint `_node/logging` was added to return all existing loggers.
+under `_node/logging` to update log levels. You can also list all existing loggers by sending a `GET` request to this API.
 ** Configurable file rotation policy for logs. The default is per-day.
 ** Support for component-level or plugin-level log settings.
 ** Unified logging across Logstash's Java and Ruby code.
-** Logs are now placed in the `LS_HOME/logs` directory, which is configurable via the `path.logs` setting.
-* Breaking Change: Changed the default log severity level to `INFO` instead of `WARN` to match Elasticsearch.
-* Show meaningful error messages for unknown CLI commands ({lsissue}5748[Issue 5748]).
-* Added monitoring API enhancements:
-** Added `duration_in_millis` metric under `/_node/stats/pipeline/events`.
-** Added JVM GC stats under `/_node/stats/jvm`.
-** Removed the `/_node/mem` resource because it's been properly moved under `/_node/jvm/mem`.
-** Added config reload stats under new resource type `_node/stats/pipeline/reloads`.
-** Added config reload enabled/disabled info to `/_node/pipeline`.
-** Added the JVM GC strategy info under `/_node/jvm`.
-** Fixed the `?human` option to work correctly for the `hot_threads` API.
-** Made sure a non-existing API endpoint correctly returns 404 and a structured error message.
-* Plugin Developers: Improved nomenclature and methods for 'threadsafe' outputs. Removed the `workers_not_supported` method ({lsissue}5662[Issue 5662]).

-
-*`Elasticsearch`*:
-
-* Breaking Change: The index template for 5.0 has been changed to reflect Elasticsearch's mapping changes. Most importantly,
-the subfield for string multi-fields has changed from `.raw` to `.keyword` to match Elasticsearch's default behavior
-(https://github.com/logstash-plugins/logstash-output-elasticsearch/issues/386[Issue 386]). See <<breaking-changes>> for details about how this change affects new and existing users.
-* Added `check_connection_timeout` parameter, which has a default of 10m.
-
-[[alpha5]]
-=== Logstash 5.0-alpha5 Release Notes
-
+** Logs are now placed in the `LS_HOME/logs` directory, which is configurable via the `path.logs` setting. For deb/rpm packages 
+logs are placed in `/var/log/logstash/` by default.
+** Changed the default log severity level to `INFO` instead of `WARN` to match Elasticsearch.
+** Logstash can now emit its log in structured, JSON format. Specify log.format=json` in the settings file 
+or via the command line ({lsissue}1569[Issue 1569]).
+* Added support for systemd and upstart so you can now manage Logstash as a service on most Linux distributions ({lsissue}5012[Issue 5012]).
+* Fixed a bug where Logstash would not shutdown if CTRL-C was used while using stdin input in the 
+configuration ({lsissue}1769[Issue 1769]).
+* Created a new `LS_HOME/data` directory to store plugin states, Logstash instance UUID, and more. This directory 
+location is configurable via the `path.data` setting in the `logstash.yml` <<logstash-settings-file,settings file>> ({lsissue}5404[Issue 5404]).
+* Made `bin/logstash -V/--version` run faster on Unix platforms.
 * Introduced a performance optimization called bi-values to store both JRuby and Java object types. This optimization
 benefits plugins written in Ruby.
-* Added support for specifying a comma-separated list of resources when calling the monitoring APIs. This can be used
-to filter the API response ({lsissue}5609[Issue 5609]).
-* Fixed the `/_node/hot_threads?human=true` human option so that it now returns a human-readable format, not JSON.
-* Added the pipeline stats from `/_node/stats/pipeline` to the parent `/_node/stats` resource for completeness.
+* Show meaningful error messages for unknown CLI commands ({lsissue}5748[Issue 5748]).
+* Added ability to configure custom garbage collection log file using `$LS_LOG_DIR`.
+* Plugin Developers: Improved nomenclature and methods for 'threadsafe' outputs. Removed the `workers_not_supported` method ({lsissue}5662[Issue 5662]).

-* Created a new `LS_HOME/data` directory to store plugin states, Logstash instance UUID, and more. This directory 
-location is configurable via the `path.data` setting in the `logstash.yml` <<logstash-settings-file,settings file>> ({lsissue}5404[Issue 5404]).
-* Made `bin/logstash -V/--version` run faster on Unix platforms.
-* Ehanced the <<monitoring,monitoring APIs>> by adding `hostname`, `http_address`, and `version` as static fields for all APIs ({lsissue}5450[Issue 5450]).
-* Added time tracking (wall-clock) to all individual filter and output instances. The goal is to help identify 
-which plugin configurations are consuming the most time. These statics are exposed by the `/_node/stats/pipeline` endpoint. See the <<pipeline-stats>> section under the <<node-stats-api>>.
-* Added the `/_node` endpoint, which provides static information for OS, JVM, and pipeline settings. See the <<node-info-api,node info API>>.
-* Moved the <<plugins-api,plugins API>> to the `_node/plugins` endpoint.
-* Moved the <<hot-threads-api,hot threads API>> to the `_node/hot_threads` endpoint.
-* Added a new `:list` property to the configuration parameters. This will allow the user to specify one or more values. 
-* Added a new URI config validator/type. This type allows plugins like the Elasticsearch output to safely log URIs for configuration. Any password information in the URI will be masked when the URI is logged.

-=== Logstash 5.0-alpha3 Release Notes
-
-* Breaking Change: Introduced a new way to configure application settings for Logstash through a `settings.yml` file. This
-file is typically located in `LS_HOME/config` or `/etc/logstash` when installed via packages. Logstash will
-not be able to start without this file, so please make sure to pass in `path.settings` if you are starting
-Logstash manually after installing it via a package (RPM or DEB) ({lsissue}4401[Issue 4401]).
-* Breaking Change: Most of the long form options (https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/logstash/5.0/command-line-flags.html) have
-been renamed to adhere to the YAML dot notation used in the settings file. Short form options have not been
-changed ({lsissue}4401[Issue 4401]).
-* Breaking Change: When Logstash is installed via DEB or RPM packages, it uses `/usr/share` and `/var` to install binaries
-and config files respectively. Previously it used the `/opt` directory. This change was done to
-make the user experience consistent with other Elastic products ({lsissue}5101[Issue 5101]).
-* Breaking Change: For plugin developers, the Event class has a new API to access its data. You will no longer be able to
-directly use the Event class through the Ruby hash paradigm. All the plugins packaged with Logstash have
-been updated to use the new API, and their versions have been bumped to the next major. ({lsissue}5141[Issue 5141])
-* Added support for systemd so you can now manage Logstash as a service on most Linux distributions ({lsissue}5012[Issue 5012]).
-* Added a new subcommand called `generate` to the `logstash-plugins` script that bootstraps a new plugin with
-the correct directory structure and all the required files.
-* Logstash can now emit its log in structured, JSON format. Specify `--log.format=json` in the settings file
-or via the command line ({lsissue}1569[Issue 1569]).
-* Added more operational information to help run Logstash in production. The `_node/stats` endpoint now 
-shows file descriptors and CPU information.
-* Fixed a bug where Logstash would not shutdown if CTRL-C was used while using stdin input in the

-=== Logstash 5.0-alpha1 Release Notes
-
-* Added APIs to monitor the Logstash pipeline. You can now query information/stats about event flow, JVM, 
-  and hot_threads.
-* Added dynamic config, a new feature to track config file for changes and restart the 
-  pipeline (same process) with updated config changes. This feature can be enabled in two 
-  ways: Passing a CLI long-form option `--auto-reload` or with short-form `-r`. Another 
-  option, `--reload-interval <seconds>` controls how often LS should check the config files 
-  for changes. Alternatively, if you don't start with the CLI option, you can send SIGHUP 
-  or `kill -1` signal to LS to reload the config file, and restart the pipeline ({lsissue}4513[Issue 4513]).
-* Added support to evaluate environment variables inside the Logstash config. You can also specify a 
-  default if the variable is not defined. The syntax is `${myVar:default}` ({lsissue}3944[Issue 3944]).
-* Improved throughput performance across the board (up by 2x in some configs) by implementing Event
