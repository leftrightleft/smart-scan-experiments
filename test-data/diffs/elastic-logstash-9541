+of fifty percent (50%) or more of the outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of 
+such entity.
+
+"You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity exercising permissions granted by 
+this License.
+
+"Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications, including but not 
+limited to software source code, documentation source, and configuration files.
+
+"Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical transformation or translation of 
+a Source form, including but not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation, 
+and conversions to other media types.
+
+"Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or Object form, made available 
+under the License, as indicated by a copyright notice that is included in or attached to the 
+work (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
+
+"Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object form, that is based on 
+(or derived from) the Work and for which the editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, 
+or other modifications represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the 
+purposes of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain separable 
+from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of, the Work and Derivative Works 
+thereof.
+
+"Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including the original version of the Work 
+and any modifications or additions to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is 
+intentionally submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner or by 
+an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of the copyright owner. For the 
+purposes of this definition, "submitted" means any form of electronic, verbal, or written 
+communication sent to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to 
+communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems, and issue tracking 
+systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the Licensor for the purpose of discussing and 
+improving the Work, but excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise 
+designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
+
+"Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity on behalf of whom a 
+Contribution has been received by Licensor and subsequently incorporated within the Work.
+
+2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each

+royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of, 
+publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the Work and such Derivative 
+Works in Source or Object form.
+
+3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each 
+Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, 
+royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have 
+made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work, where such license 
+applies only to those patent claims licensable by such Contributor that are necessarily 
+infringed by their Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s) with the 
+Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You institute patent litigation against 
+any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work or 
+a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct or contributory patent 
+infringement, then any patent licenses granted to You under this License for that Work shall 
+terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.
+
+4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or Derivative Works 
+thereof in any medium, with or without modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided 
+that You meet the following conditions:
+
+You must give any other recipients of the Work or Derivative Works a copy of this License; 
+and
+
+You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices stating that You changed the 
+files; and
+
+You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works that You distribute, all 
+copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices from the Source form of the Work, 
+excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works; and
+
+If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its distribution, then any Derivative 
+Works that You distribute must include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained 
+within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the 
+Derivative Works, in at least one of the following places: within a NOTICE text file 
+distributed as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or documentation, if 
+provided along with the Derivative Works; or, within a display generated by the Derivative 
+Works, if and wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents of the NOTICE 
+file are for informational purposes only and do not modify the License. You may add Your own 
+attribution notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum 
+to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided that such additional attribution notices cannot 
+be construed as modifying the License. You may add Your own copyright statement to Your 
+modifications and may provide additional or different license terms and conditions for use, 
+reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a 
+whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with 
+the conditions stated in this License.
+
+5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution 
+intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor shall be under the 
+terms and conditions of this License, without any additional terms or conditions. 
+Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify the terms of any 
+separate license agreement you may have executed with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
+
+6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks, 
+service marks, or product names of the Licensor, except as required for reasonable and 
+customary use in describing the origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE 
+file.
+
+7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, 
+Licensor provides the Work (and each Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" 
+BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, including, 
+without limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, 
+MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for 
+determining the appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any risks 
+associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
+
+8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory, whether in tort 
+(including negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required by applicable law (such as 
+deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be 
+liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or 
+consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this License or out of the use 
+or inability to use the Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill, 
+work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or 
+losses), even if such Contributor has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
+
+9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work or Derivative 
+Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, 
+warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this 
+License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on 
+Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to 
+indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or 
+claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or 
+additional liability.
