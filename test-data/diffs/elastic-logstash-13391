+===== ECS compatibility is now on by default
+Many plugins can now be run in a mode that avoids implicit conflict with the Elastic Common Schema.
+This mode is controlled individually with each plugin's `ecs_compatibility` option, which defaults to the value of the Logstash `pipeline.ecs_compatibility` setting.
+In Logstash 8, this compatibility mode will be on-by-default for all pipelines. https://github.com/elastic/logstash/issues/11623[#11623]
+
+If you wish to _lock in_ a pipeline's behaviour from Logstash 7.x before upgrading to Logstash 8, you can set  `pipeline.ecs_compatibility: disabled` to its definition in `pipelines.yml` (or globally in `logstash.yml`).

 Any plugin that supports this mode will also have an `ecs_compatibility` option, which allows you to configure which mode the individual plugin instance should operate in.

+This allows you to configure plugins to use a specific version of ECS or to use their legacy non-ECS behavior.
 
 ECS compatibility modes do not prevent you from explicitly configuring a plugin in a manner that conflicts with ECS.
 Instead, they ensure that _implicit_ configuration avoids conflicts.

 ===== Configuring ECS
 
-ECS will be on by default in a future release of {ls}, but you can begin using it now by configuring individual plugins with `ecs_compatibility`.
-You can also "lock in" the existing non-ECS behavior for an entire pipeline to ensure its behavior doesn't change when you perform future upgrades.
+In {ls} 8, all plugins are run in ECS compatibility {ls8-ecs-major-version} mode by default, but you can opt out at the plugin, pipeline, or system level to maintain legacy behavior.
+This can be helpful if you have very complex pipelines that were defined pre-ECS, to allow you to either upgrade them or to avoid doing so independently of your {ls} 8.x upgrade.
