+=== Logstash 5.0-alpha2 Release Notes
+
+* Added the `--preserve` option to the `bin/logstash-plugin` install command. This option allows you to preserve gem options that are already specified in the `Gemfile`. Previously, these options were overwritten.
+* Added support for `DEBUG=1` when running any plugin-related commands. This option gives you a bit more information about what the bundler is doing.
+* Added reload support to the init script so you can do `service logstash reload`.
+* Fixed use of the `KILL_ON_STOP_TIMEOUT` variable in the init script to allow Logstash to force stop ({lsissue}4991[Issue 4991]).
+* Upgraded to JRuby 1.7.25.
+* Renamed filenames for Debian and RPM artifacts to match Elasticsearch's naming scheme. The metadata is still the same, so upgrades will not be affected. If you have automated downloads for Logstash, please make sure you use the updated URLs ({lsissue}5100[Issue 5100]).
