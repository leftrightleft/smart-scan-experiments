-:ecs-default: The `pipeline.ecs_compatibility` setting is available in {logstash-ref}/logstash-settings-file.html[`logstash.yml`] and `pipelines.yml`. Any value in `pipeline.ecs_compatibility` other than `disabled` is considered BETA and unsupported until Logstash 8.0 and the final 7.x version are released. Having this pipeline level flag set will cause even patch-level upgrades to automatically consume breaking changes in the upgraded plugins, changing the shape of data the plugin produces.
 
+:ecs-default: When the `ecs_compatibility` option for this plugin is not explicitly set, its effective value depends on the `pipeline.ecs_compatibility` setting for the pipeline in `pipelines.yml`, or globally in {logstash-ref}/logstash-settings-file.html[`logstash.yml`], allowing you to specify your preferred behavior at the plugin, pipeline, or system level. If no preference is specified, the default value is `v8` for Logstash 8 or `disabled` for all earlier releases of Logstash. For more information about ECS compatibility settings in Logstash and plugins, see {logstash-ref}/ls-ecs.
