 ## Reporting a Vulnerability
 
-Use this section to tell people how to report a vulnerability.
-
-Tell them where to go, how often they can expect to get an update on a
-reported vulnerability, what to expect if the vulnerability is accepted or
-declined, etc.
+If you detect or suspect a vulnerability, report it immediately by creating a [Draft Security Advisory](https://github.com/octodemo/demo-vulnerabilities-ghas/security/advisories/new) on the Security Tab.  Be sure to include all relevant information, but do not wait to create the advisory if you have only incomplete information.  For more information, refer to the [DevSecOps Policy Guide](https://wouldntthisbegreat.com).
