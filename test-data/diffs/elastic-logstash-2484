+## Drip Launcher
+
+[Drip](https://github.com/ninjudd/drip) is a launcher for the Java Virtual Machine that provides much faster startup times than the `java` command. The drip script is intended to be a drop-in replacement for the java command, only faster. We recommend using drip during development.

+To tell Logstash to use drip, either set the `USE_DRIP=1` environment variable or set `` JAVACMD=`which drip` ``.

+**Caveats**
+
+Unlike [nailgun](https://github.com/martylamb/nailgun), drip does not reuse the same JVM. So once your app quits, drip will launch another JVM. This means that if you try to re-run Logstash right after it exited, you might still have a startup delay
