+==== When to Upgrade

+Fresh installations can and should start with the same version across the Elastic Stack.
+
+Elasticsearch 7.0 does not require Logstash 7.0. An Elasticsearch 7.0 cluster
+will happily receive data from earlier versions of Logstash via the default
+HTTP communication layer. This provides some flexibility to decide when to
+upgrade Logstash relative to an Elasticsearch upgrade. It may or may not be
+convenient for you to upgrade them together, and it is not required to be done
+at the same time as long as Elasticsearch is upgraded first.
+
+You should upgrade in a timely manner to get the performance improvements that
+come with Logstash 7.0, but do so in the way that makes the most sense for your
+environment.
+
+[float]
+==== When Not to Upgrade
+
+If any Logstash plugin that you require is not compatible with Logstash 7.0, then you should wait until it is ready
+before upgrading.
+
+Although we make great efforts to ensure compatibility, Logstash 7.0 is not completely backwards compatible. As noted
+in the Elastic Stack upgrade guide, Logstash 7.0 should not be upgraded before Elasticsearch 7.0. This is both
+practical and because some Logstash 7.0 plugins may attempt to use features of Elasticsearch 7.0 that did not exist
+in earlier versions. For example, if you attempt to send the 7.x template to a cluster before Elasticsearch 7.0, then 
+all indexing likely fail. If you use your own custom template with Logstash,
+then this issue can be ignored.

+coming[7.0.0]
+
+Before upgrading Logstash:
+
+* Read the <<releasenotes>>.
+* Read the <<breaking-changes,breaking changes>> docs. 
++
+There you can find info on these topics and more:
+
+** Java execution engine enabled by default
+** Field parser is more strict and how that affects processing
+** Beats conforms to the Elastic Common Schema (ECS) and how that impacts {ls}
+ 
+//TO DO:  ^^  Add links  <<java-exec-default>> and <<field-ref-strict>> and <<beats-ecs>> after breaking changes are merged 
+ 
+If you are installing Logstash with other components in the Elastic Stack, also see the
+{stack-ref}/index.html[Elastic Stack installation and upgrade documentation].
+
+NOTE: Upgrading between non-consecutive major versions (5.x to 7.x, for example) is not
+supported. We recommend that you upgrade to 6.x, and then upgrade to 7.x.

+==== Upgrade to {ls} 6.7 before upgrading to 7.0
+
+If you haven't already, upgrade to version 6.7 before you upgrade to 7.0. If
+you're using other products in the {stack}, upgrade {ls} as part of the
+{stack-ref}/upgrading-elastic-stack.html[{stack} upgrade process].
+
+TIP: Upgrading to {ls} 6.7 will give you a head-start on new 7.0 features, including
+the java execution engine and the strict field reference parser, while you're still running 6.x.
+This step helps reduce risk and makes roll backs easier if you hit
+a snag.
+
+//TO DO:  Add links [[field-ref-strict]] and [[java-exec-default]] after upgrade docs are merged
+
+Upgrading to 6.7 is required because the {es} index template was modified to
+be compatible with {es} 7.0 (the `_type` setting changed from `doc` to `_doc`).
