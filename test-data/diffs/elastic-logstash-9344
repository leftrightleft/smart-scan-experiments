 * The `pipeline.workers` setting determines how many threads to run for filter and output processing. If you find that events are backing up, or that the CPU is not saturated, consider increasing the value of this parameter to make better use of available processing power. Good results can even be found increasing this number past the number of available processors as these threads may spend significant time in an I/O wait state when writing to external systems. Legal values for this parameter are positive integers.
 
-* The `pipeline.batch.size` setting defines the maximum number of events an individual worker thread collects before attempting to execute filters and outputs. Larger batch sizes are generally more efficient, but increase memory overhead. Some hardware configurations require you to increase JVM heap size by setting the `LS_HEAP_SIZE` variable to avoid performance degradation with this option. Values of this parameter in excess of the optimum range cause performance degradation due to frequent garbage collection or JVM crashes related to out-of-memory exceptions. Output plugins can process each batch as a logical unit. The Elasticsearch output, for example, issues https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/docs-bulk.html[bulk requests] for each batch received. Tuning the `pipeline.batch.size` setting adjusts the size of bulk requests sent to Elasticsearch.

 * The `pipeline.batch.delay` setting rarely needs to be tuned. This setting adjusts the latency of the Logstash pipeline. Pipeline batch delay is the maximum amount of time in milliseconds that Logstash waits for new messages after receiving an event in the current pipeline worker thread. After this time elapses, Logstash begins to execute filters and outputs.The maximum time that Logstash waits between receiving an event and processing that event in a filter is the product of the `pipeline.batch.delay` and  `pipeline.batch.size` settings.

 If you plan to modify the default pipeline settings, take into account the
 following suggestions:
 
-* The total number of inflight events is determined by the product of the  `pipeline.workers` and `pipeline.batch.size` settings. This product is referred to as the _inflight count_.  Keep the value of the inflight count in mind as you adjust the `pipeline.workers` and `pipeline.batch.size` settings. Pipelines that intermittently receive large events at irregular intervals require sufficient memory to handle these spikes. Configure the `LS_HEAP_SIZE` variable accordingly.
