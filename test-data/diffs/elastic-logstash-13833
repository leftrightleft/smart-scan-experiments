+The default size of 64mb is a good value for most users, and changing this value is unlikely to have performance benefits. 
+If you change the page capacity of an existing queue, the new size applies only to the new page.
 `queue.drain`:: Specify `true` if you want Logstash to wait until the persistent queue is drained before shutting down. The amount of time it takes to drain the queue depends on the number of events that have accumulated in the queue. Therefore, you should avoid using this setting unless the queue, even when full, is relatively small and can be drained quickly. 
 `queue.max_events`:: The maximum number of events not yet read by the pipeline worker. The default is 0 (unlimited).
 We use this setting for internal testing.

+We do not check to see if the disk has enough capacity for `queue.max_bytes` for all queues.

 TIP: If you are using persistent queues to protect against data loss, but don't
 require much buffering, you can set `queue.max_bytes` to a smaller value.
