+== Release Notes
+
+This section summarizes the changes in the following releases:
+
+* <<logstash-5-6-0,Logstash 5.6.0>>
+
+[[logstash-5-6-0]]
+=== Logstash 5.6.0 Release Notes
+
+* Introduced modules for Netflow and ArcSight data. Modules contain pre-packaged Logstash configuration, Kibana dashboards 
+  and other metadata files to ease the set up of the Elastic stack for certain data sources. The goal of these modules are 
+  to provide an end-to-end, 5-min getting started experience for a user exploring a data source.
+* Added a new setting called `config.support_escapes`. This setting enables the use of escape characters such as `\n` in 
+  the Logstash configuration.
+* Improved the performance of metrics collection and reporting infrastructure. Overall, in this release, there is lower load 
+  average, less GC and higher throughput when running Logstash.
+* When processing events from the DLQ, there are added checks now to stop them from being written to the DLQ again.
+* Fixed an issue which would crash Logstash when accessing DLQ events using a timestamp range.
+

+
+==== Filter Plugins
+
+*`GeoIP`*: The free GeoIPLite2-ASN database from MaxMind is now bundled in Logstash to be able to look up ASN data out 
+  of the box.
