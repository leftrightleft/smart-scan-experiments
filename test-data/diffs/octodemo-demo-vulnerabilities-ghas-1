-Welcome to Apache ActiveMQ
-=======================================================================
-Apache ActiveMQ is a high performance Apache 2.0 licensed
-Message Broker and JMS 1.1 implementation.
+# Demo GHAS 
 
-Getting Started
-===============
-To help you get started, try the following links:
+## Code Scanning Alerts & Dependency Alerts on non-default Branches
 
-Getting Started
-- http://activemq.apache.org/version-5-getting-started.html
+This repo is a copy of the [Apache ActiveMQ repo](https://github.com/apache/activemq).
 
-Building
-- http://activemq.apache.org/version-5-getting-started.html#GettingStarted-WindowsSourceInstallation
-- http://activemq.apache.org/version-5-getting-started.html#GettingStarted-UnixSourceInstallation
+It was used it due to the amount of vulnerabilities it displays once CodeQL Action perform its scans.
 
-Examples
-- http://activemq.apache.org/examples.html
+#### :rotating_light: Do not use it to demo features not related to GHAS Code Scanning and Vulnerabilities alerts on non-default branches
 
-We welcome contributions of all kinds, for details of how you can help
-http://activemq.apache.org/contributing.html
+## How to use it
+<wait for it>
 
-Please refer to the website for details of finding the issue tracker,
-email lists, wiki or IRC channel at http://activemq.apache.org/
+#### `codeql.yml`
+Workflow with the CodeQL analysis. Runs at 0:00 UTC on Sunday.
 
-Please help us make Apache ActiveMQ better - we appreciate any feedback
-you may have.
+You can check the results of its runs on the [Security Tab](https://github.com/octodemo/demo-vulnerabilities-ghas/security/code-scanning).
 
-Enjoy!
+#### `dependencies.yml`
+Workflow that checks every new PR that changes dependencies files. If the PR introduces dependencies with known vulnerabilities, it fails. PRs that don't change dependencies are not checked.
