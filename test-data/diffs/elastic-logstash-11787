+===== Collectors
+
+Collectors, as their name implies, collect things. In monitoring for Logstash, 
+collectors are just <<pipeline,Inputs>> in the same way that ordinary Logstash 
+configurations provide inputs.
+
+Like monitoring for {es}, each collector can create zero or more monitoring 
+documents. As it is currently implemented, each Logstash node runs two types of 
+collectors: one for node stats and one for pipeline stats.

+| Node Stats      | `logstash_stats`
+| Gathers details about the running node, such as memory utilization and CPU
+usage (for example, `GET /_stats`).
+
+This runs on every Logstash node with monitoring enabled. One common
+failure is that Logstash directories are copied with their `path.data` directory
+included (`./data` by default), which copies the persistent UUID of the Logstash
+node along with it. As a result, it generally appears that one or more Logstash
+nodes are failing to collect monitoring data, when in fact they are all really
+misreporting as the _same_ Logstash node. Re-use `path.data` directories only 
+when upgrading Logstash, such that upgraded nodes replace the previous versions.
+| Pipeline Stats | `logstash_state`
+| Gathers details about the node's running pipelines, which powers the 
+Monitoring Pipeline UI.
+|=======================
+
+Per collection interval, which defaults to 10 seconds (`10s`), each collector is
+run. The failure of an individual collector does not impact any other collector. 
+Each collector, as an ordinary Logstash input, creates a separate Logstash event 
+in its isolated monitoring pipeline. The Logstash output then sends the data.
+
+The collection interval can be configured dynamically and you can also disable 
+data collection. For more information about the configuration options for the

+WARNING: Unlike {es} and {kib} monitoring, there is no 
+`xpack.monitoring.collection.enabled` setting on Logstash. You must use the

+
+If gaps exist in the monitoring charts in {kib}, it is typically because either 
+a collector failed or the monitoring cluster did not receive the data (for 
+example, it was being restarted). In the event that a collector fails, a logged 
+error should exist on the node that attempted to perform the collection.

+++++
+<titleabbrev>Legacy internal collection</titleabbrev>
+++++
+
+IMPORTANT: Use <<monitoring-internal-collection,internal collection>> or
+<<monitoring-with-metricbeat, {metricbeat} collection>> instead of legacy
+internal collection. If you are currently using legacy internal collection, you
+should migrate to either Metricbeat collection or internal collection.
+
+==== Migrating from legacy internal collection to new internal collection
+
+Migrating from legacy internal collection to new
+<<monitoring-internal-collection,Internal collection>> is straightforward. 
+
+** Drop the `xpack.` prefix from your configuration settings. 
+For example, `xpack.monitoring.enabled` is now `monitoring.enabled`. See
+<<monitoring-settings, Monitoring Settings>> for the full list.
+** Change the hosts settings and configuration options to point to the monitoring
+cluster instead of the production cluster.
+** If you donâ€™t have an Elasticsearch output plugin configured in the pipelines,
+add the <<monitoring-cluster-uuid,`monitoring.cluster_uuid`>> setting to your 
+logstash.yml.
+
+==== Components for legacy internal collection
+
+Monitoring {ls} with legacy internal collection uses these components:
+
+* <<logstash-monitoring-collectors-legacy,Collectors>>
+* <<logstash-monitoring-output-legacy,Output>>
+
+These pieces live outside of the default Logstash pipeline in a dedicated monitoring
+pipeline. This configuration ensures that all data and processing has a minimal
+impact on ordinary Logstash processing. Existing Logstash features, such as the
+<<plugins-outputs-elasticsearch,`elasticsearch` output>>, can be reused to
+benefit from its retry policies. 
+
+NOTE: The `elasticsearch` output that is used for monitoring {ls} is 
+configured exclusively through settings found in `logstash.yml`. It is not 
+configured by using anything from the Logstash configurations that might also be 
+using their own separate `elasticsearch` outputs.
+
+
+The production {es} cluster should be configured to receive {ls} monitoring
+data. This configuration enables the production {es} cluster to add metadata
+(for example, its cluster UUID) to the Logstash monitoring data and then route
+it to the monitoring clusters. For more information  about typical monitoring
+architectures, see  {ref}/how-monitoring-works.html[How monitoring works] in the

 Make sure monitoring is enabled on your {es} cluster. Then configure *one* of
 these methods to collect {ls} metrics:
 
-* <<monitoring-with-metricbeat, {metricbeat} collection>>
-* <<monitoring-internal-collection,Internal collection>>
+* <<monitoring-with-metricbeat, {metricbeat} collection>>. Metricbeat collects
+monitoring data from your {ls} instance and sends it directly to your monitoring
+cluster. The benefit of Metricbeat collection is that the monitoring
+agent remains active even if the {ls} instance does not.
+
+* <<monitoring-internal-collection,Internal collection>>. Internal collectors send
+monitoring data directly to your monitoring cluster. The benefit of internal
+collection is that you have fewer pieces of software to install and maintain.
+
+* <<monitoring-internal-collection-legacy,Legacy internal collection>>. Legacy
+internal collectors send monitoring data to your production cluster.
+This is no longer a preferred approach. Use
+<<monitoring-internal-collection,internal collection>> or
+<<monitoring-with-metricbeat, {metricbeat} collection>> instead.
