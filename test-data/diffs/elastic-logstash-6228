+Logstash emits internal logs during its operation, which are placed in `LS_HOME/logs` (or `/var/log/logstash` for
+DEB/RPM). The default logging level is `INFO`. Logstash's logging framework is based on
+http://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/[Log4j2 framework], and much of its functionality is exposed directly to users.
 
 When debugging problems, particularly problems with plugins, it can be helpful to increase the logging level to `DEBUG` 
 to emit more verbose messages. Previously, you could only set a log level that applied to the entire Logstash product.
