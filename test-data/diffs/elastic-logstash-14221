-Logstash is an open source data collection engine with real-time pipelining capabilities. Logstash can dynamically
-unify data from disparate sources and normalize the data into destinations of your choice. Cleanse and democratize all
-your data for diverse advanced downstream analytics and visualization use cases.
-
-While Logstash originally drove innovation in log collection, its capabilities extend well beyond that use case. Any
-type of event can be enriched and transformed with a broad array of input, filter, and output plugins, with many
-native codecs further simplifying the ingestion process. Logstash accelerates your insights by harnessing a greater
-volume and variety of data.
