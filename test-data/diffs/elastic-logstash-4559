 The `--pipeline-batch-size` or `-b` parameter defines the maximum number of events an individual worker thread collects before attempting to execute filters and outputs. Larger batch sizes are generally more efficient, but increase memory overhead. Some hardware configurations require you to increase JVM heap size by setting the `LS_HEAP_SIZE` variable to avoid performance degradation with this option. Values of this parameter in excess of the optimum range cause performance degradation due to frequent garbage collection or JVM crashes related to out-of-memory exceptions. Output plugins can process each batch as a logical unit. The Elasticsearch output, for example, issues https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/docs-bulk.html[bulk requests] for each batch received. Tuning the `-b` parameter adjusts the size of bulk requests sent to Elasticsearch.
 
-The `--pipeline-batch-delay` option rarely needs to be tuned. This option adjusts the latency of the Logstash pipeline. Pipeline batch delay is the maximum amount of time in milliseconds that Logstash waits for new messages after receiving an event in the current pipeline worker thread. After this time elapses, Logstash beings to execute filters and outputs.The maximum time that Logstash waits between receiving an event and processing that event in a filter is the product of the `pipeline_batch_delay` and  `pipeline_batch_size` settings.
