-# Originally written to translate HTTP response codes 
-# but turned into a general translation tool which uses
-# configured has or/and .yaml files as a dictionary.
-# response codes in default dictionary were scraped from 
-# 'gem install cheat; cheat status_codes'
+# A general search and replace tool which uses a configured hash
+# and/or a YAML file to determine replacement values.
 #
-# Alternatively for simple string search and replacements for just a few values
-# use the gsub function of the mutate filter.
+# The dictionary entries can be specified in one of two ways: First,
+# the "dictionary" configuration item may contain a hash representing
+# the mapping. Second, an external YAML file (readable by logstash) may be specified
+# in the "dictionary_path" configuration item. These two methods may not be used
+# in conjunction; it will produce an error.
+#
+# Operationally, if the event field specified in the "field" configuration
+# matches the EXACT contents of a dictionary entry key (or matches a regex if
+# "regex" configuration item has been enabled), the field's value will be substituted
+# with the matched key's value from the dictionary.
+#
+# By default, the translate filter will replace the contents of the 
+# maching event field (in-place). However, by using the "destination"
+# configuration item, you may also specify a target event field to
+# populate with the new translated value.

+# Alternatively, for simple string search and replacements for just a few values

+  #
+  #     foo: bar
+  #
+  # Then, if Logstash received an event with the field `foo` set to "bar", the destination
+  # field would be set to "bar". However, if Logstash received an event with `foo` set to "nope",
+  # then the destination field would still be populated, but with the value of "no match".
