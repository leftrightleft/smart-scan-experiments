 ===== File rotation
 
 Dead letter queues have a built-in file rotation policy that manages the file
 size of the queue. When the file size reaches a preconfigured threshold, a new
 file is created automatically.

 By default, the maximum size of each dead letter queue is set to 1024mb. To
 change this setting, use the `dead_letter_queue.max_bytes` option.  Entries

 Set the value to `drop_older` to remove the oldest events to make space for new ones.
 
+[[age-policy]]
+====== Age policy
+You can use the age policy to automatically control the volume of events in the dead letter queue.
+Use the the `dead_letter_queue.retain.age` setting (in `logstash.yml` or `pipelines.yml`) to have {ls}
+remove events that are older than a value you define.
+Available time units are `d`, `h`, `m`, `s` respectively for days, hours, minutes and seconds.
+There is no default time unit, so you need to specify it.

+The age policy is verified and applied on event writes and during pipeline shutdown.
+For that reason, your dead-letter-queue folder may store expired events for longer than specified,
+and the reader pipeline could possibly encounter outdated events.
