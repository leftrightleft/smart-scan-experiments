-== Logstash Introduction
-
-Logstash is an open source data collection engine with real-time pipelining capabilities. Logstash can dynamically
-unify data from disparate sources and normalize the data into destinations of your choice. Cleanse and democratize all
-your data for diverse advanced downstream analytics and visualization use cases.
-
-While Logstash originally drove innovation in log collection, its capabilities extend well beyond that use case. Any
-type of event can be enriched and transformed with a broad array of input, filter, and output plugins, with many
-native codecs further simplifying the ingestion process. Logstash accelerates your insights by harnessing a greater
-volume and variety of data.

-=== Installing from a Downloaded Binary
-
-The {ls} binaries are available from 
-https://www.elastic.co/downloads/logstash[https://www.elastic.co/downloads].
-Download the Logstash installation file for your host environment--TAR.GZ, DEB,
-ZIP, or RPM. 
-
-Unpack the file. Do not install Logstash into a directory path that
-contains colon (:) characters.
-
-[NOTE]
---
-These packages are free to use under the Elastic license. They contain open 
-source and free commercial features and access to paid commercial features.  
-{kibana-ref}/managing-licenses.html[Start a 30-day trial] to try out all of the 
-paid commercial features. See the 
-https://www.elastic.co/subscriptions[Subscriptions] page for information about 
-Elastic license levels. 
-
-Alternatively, you can download an `oss` package, which contains only features 
-that are available under the Apache 2.0 license. 
---
-
-On supported Linux operating systems, you can use a package manager to install Logstash.

-[[package-repositories]]
-=== Installing from Package Repositories
-
-We also have repositories available for APT and YUM based distributions. Note
-that we only provide binary packages, but no source packages, as the packages
-are created as part of the Logstash build.
-
-We have split the Logstash package repositories by version into separate urls
-to avoid accidental upgrades across major versions. For all {major-version}.y
-releases use {major-version} as version number.
-
-We use the PGP key
-https://pgp.mit.edu/pks/lookup?op=vindex&search=0xD27D666CD88E42B4[D88E42B4],
-Elastic's Signing Key, with fingerprint

-
-to sign all our packages. It is available from https://pgp.mit.edu.
-
-[NOTE]
---
-When installing from a package repository (or from the DEB or RPM installation file),
-you will need to run Logstash as a service. Please refer to
-{logstash-ref}/running-logstash.html[Running Logstash as a Service] for more
-information.
-
-For testing purposes, you may still run Logstash from the command line, but
-you may need to define the default setting options (described in
-{logstash-ref}/dir-layout.html[Logstash Directory Layout]) manually. Please
-refer to {logstash-ref}/running-logstash-command-line.html[Running Logstash from the Command Line]
-for more information.

-==================================================
-Use the `echo` method described above to add the Logstash repository.  Do not

-error like the following:

-    Unable to find expected entry 'main/source/Sources' in Release file (Wrong sources.list entry or malformed file)

-Just delete the `deb-src` entry from the `/etc/apt/sources.list` file and the
