 The Logstash event processing pipeline coordinates the execution of inputs,
 filters, and outputs. 
 
-Each input stage in the Logstash pipeline runs in its own thread. Inputs write events to a common Java https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/SynchronousQueue.html[SynchronousQueue]. This queue holds no events, instead transferring each pushed event to a free worker, blocking if all workers are busy. Each pipeline worker thread takes a batch of events off this queue, creating a buffer for each worker, runs the batch of events through the configured filters, then runs the filtered events through any outputs. The size of the batch and number of pipeline worker threads are configurable (see <<tuning-logstash>>).

 By default, Logstash uses in-memory bounded queues between pipeline stages
 (input → filter and filter → output) to buffer events. If Logstash terminates
