-:ecs-default: When the `ecs_compatibility` option for this plugin is not explicitly set, its effective value depends on the `pipeline.ecs_compatibility` setting for the pipeline in `pipelines.yml`, or globally in {logstash-ref}/logstash-settings-file.html[`logstash.yml`], allowing you to specify your preferred behavior at the plugin, pipeline, or system level. If no preference is specified, the default value is `v8` for Logstash 8 or `disabled` for all earlier releases of Logstash. For more information about ECS compatibility settings in Logstash and plugins, see {logstash-ref}/ls-ecs.
