-* Fix bug where the Elasticsearch output would not correctly log errors but rather log an exception in the error handler, thus hiding the actual error message.

+* This list does not include all breaking changes, please consult the <<breaking-changes,breaking changes>> document separately.
 * Added new `logstash.yml` setting: `config.support_escapes`. When enabled, Logstash will interpret escape sequences in
   strings in the pipeline configuration.
-* Breaking: The setting `config.reload.interval` has been changed to use time value strings such as `5m`, `10s`, etc for
-  convenience. Previously, users had to convert this to a second time value themselves.
-* Breaking: The list of plugins bundled with Logstash 6.0.0-beta1 release has changed. Please consult the breaking changes document
-  for a complete list.
+* Added an explicit --setup phase for modules. This phase is used to install dashboards and the Elasticsearch template.
+* Added support for running multiple pipelines in the same Logstash instance. Running multiple pipelines
+  allows users to isolate data flow, provide separate runtime pipeline parameters and helps simplify complex
+  configurations. This can be configured via the new `pipelines.yml` file.

 * Added an {xpack} feature to manage Logstash configurations centrally in Elasticsearch. We've also added a UI to manage
   configurations directly in Kibana without having to restart Logstash.
 * Users can now visualize the Logstash configuration pipeline as part of the {xpack} monitoring feature.
-* We now report an error if config file referenced in the `pipelines.yml` is missing.

-[[logstash-6-0-0-alpha2]]
-=== Logstash 6.0.0-alpha2 Release Notes
-
-* Breaking: Currently, when Logstash is installed and set up via package managers, it loads all files found
-  in `/etc/logstash/conf.d` as configuration. This can be problematic if there are non-configuration files in this
-  folder. Starting from alpha2, Logstash will only glob files ending with `.conf` extension in `/etc/logstash/conf.d` ({lsissue}6979)[Issue 6979)]).
-* Added support for running multiple pipelines in the same Logstash instance. Running multiple pipelines
-  allow users to isolate data flow, provide separate runtime pipeline parameters and helps simplify complex
-  configurations.
-* A new `pipelines.yml` configuration file has been added to define pipelines.

-=== Logstash 6.0.0-alpha1 Release Notes

-* Introducing a new internal representation for the existing Logstash configuration that forms the
