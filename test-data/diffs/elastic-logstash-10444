-  2. GRANT OF RIGHTS
+Copyright (c) Henry Poydar
 
-      a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor
-         hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide,
-         royalty-free copyright license to reproduce, prepare
-         derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform,
-         distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such
-         Contributor, if any, and such derivative works, in source
-         code and object code form.
-
-      b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor
-         hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide,
-         royalty-free patent license under Licensed Patents to make,
-         use, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise transfer the
-         Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in source code and
-         object code form. This patent license shall apply to the
-         combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at the
-         time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such
-         addition of the Contribution causes such combination to be
-         covered by the Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not
-         apply to any other combinations which include the
-         Contribution. No hardware per se is licensed hereunder.
-
-      c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants
-         the licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no
-         assurances are provided by any Contributor that the Program
-         does not infringe the patent or other intellectual property
-         rights of any other entity. Each Contributor disclaims any
-         liability to Recipient for claims brought by any other entity
-         based on infringement of intellectual property rights or
-         otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and
-         licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes
-         sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual property
-         rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party patent
-         license is required to allow Recipient to distribute the
-         Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that
-         license before distributing the Program.
-
-      d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has
-         sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to
-         grant the copyright license set forth in this Agreement.

-  4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION
+You may obtain a copy of the License at:
 
-  Commercial distributors of software may accept certain
-  responsibilities with respect to end users, business partners and
-  the like. While this license is intended to facilitate the
-  commercial use of the Program, the Contributor who includes the
-  Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a manner
-  which does not create potential liability for other Contributors.
-  Therefore, if a Contributor includes the Program in a commercial
-  product offering, such Contributor ("Commercial Contributor") hereby
-  agrees to defend and indemnify every other Contributor ("Indemnified
-  Contributor") against any losses, damages and costs (collectively
-  "Losses") arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal actions
-  brought by a third party against the Indemnified Contributor to the
-  extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial
-  Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program in a
-  commercial product offering. The obligations in this section do not
-  apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged
-  intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an
-  Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial
-  Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial
-  Contributor to control, and cooperate with the Commercial
-  Contributor in, the defense and any related settlement negotiations.
-  The Indemnified Contributor may participate in any such claim at its
-  own expense.
+http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0
 
-  For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial
-  product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial
-  Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance
-  claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance
-  claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's
-  responsibility alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor
-  would have to defend claims against the other Contributors related
-  to those performance claims and warranties, and if a court requires
-  any other Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial
-  Contributor must pay those damages.
 
-  5. NO WARRANTY
 
-  EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS
-  PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF
-  ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION,
-  ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT,
-  MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient
-  is solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using
-  and distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with
-  its exercise of rights under this Agreement , including but not
-  limited to the risks and costs of program errors, compliance with
-  applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs or equipment,
-  and unavailability or interruption of operations.

-  GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH

+   1. Definitions.
 
-  7. GENERAL
+      "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
+      and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.
 
-  If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under
-  applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability
-  of the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further
-  action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to
-  the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and
-  enforceable.
+      "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
+      the copyright owner that is granting the License.
 
-  If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity
-  (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that
-  the Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other
-  software or hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then
-  such Recipient's rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate
-  as of the date such litigation is filed.
+      "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
+      other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
+      control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
+      "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
+      direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
+      otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
+      outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.
 
-  All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it
-  fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this
-  Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of
-  time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's
-  rights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use
-  and distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable.
-  However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement and any
-  licenses granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue
-  and survive.
-
-  Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this
-  Agreement, but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is
-  copyrighted and may only be modified in the following manner. The
-  Agreement Steward reserves the right to publish new versions
-  (including revisions) of this Agreement from time to time. No one
-  other than the Agreement Steward has the right to modify this
-  Agreement. The Eclipse Foundation is the initial Agreement Steward.
-  The Eclipse Foundation may assign the responsibility to serve as the
-  Agreement Steward to a suitable separate entity. Each new version of
-  the Agreement will be given a distinguishing version number. The
-  Program (including Contributions) may always be distributed subject
-  to the version of the Agreement under which it was received. In
-  addition, after a new version of the Agreement is published,
-  Contributor may elect to distribute the Program (including its
-  Contributions) under the new version. Except as expressly stated in
-  Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no rights or
-  licenses to the intellectual property of any Contributor under this
-  Agreement, whether expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise.
-  All rights in the Program not expressly granted under this Agreement
-  are reserved.
-
-  This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and
-  the intellectual property laws of the United States of America. No
-  party to this Agreement will bring a legal action under this
-  Agreement more than one year after the cause of action arose. Each
-  party waives its rights to a jury trial in any resulting litigation.

-  THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.
+      "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
+      exercising permissions granted by this License.
 
-  1. DEFINITIONS
+      "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
+      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
+      source, and configuration files.
 
-  "Contribution" means:
+      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
+      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
+      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
+      and conversions to other media types.
 
-  a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial code and
-    documentation distributed under this Agreement, and
+      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
+      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
+      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
+      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
 
-  b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:
+      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
+      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
+      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
+      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
+      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
+      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
+      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
 
-  i) changes to the Program, and
+      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
+      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
+      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
+      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
+      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
+      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
+      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
+      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
+      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
+      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
+      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
+      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
+      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
 
-  ii) additions to the Program;
+      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
+      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
+      subsequently incorporated within the Work.
 
-  where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate
-  from and are distributed by that particular Contributor. A
-  Contribution 'originates' from a Contributor if it was added to the
-  Program by such Contributor itself or anyone acting on such
-  Contributor's behalf. Contributions do not include additions to the
-  Program which: (i) are separate modules of software distributed in
-  conjunction with the Program under their own license agreement,
-  and (ii) are not derivative works of the Program.
+   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
+      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
+      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
+      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
+      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
+      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
 
-  "Contributor" means any person or entity that distributes the Program.
+   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
+      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
+      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
+      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
+      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
+      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
+      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
+      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
+      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
+      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
+      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
+      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
+      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
+      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
+      as of the date such litigation is filed.
 
-  "Licensed Patents " mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor
-  which are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution
-  alone or when combined with the Program.
+   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
+      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
+      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
+      meet the following conditions:
 
-  "Program" means the Contributions distributed in accordance with this Agreement.
+      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
+          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
 
-  "Recipient" means anyone who receives the Program under this
-  Agreement, including all Contributors.
+      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
+          stating that You changed the files; and
 
-  2. GRANT OF RIGHTS
+      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
+          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
+          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
+          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
+          the Derivative Works; and
 
-  a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor
-  hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free
-  copyright license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly
-  display, publicly perform, distribute and sublicense the Contribution
-  of such Contributor, if any, and such derivative works, in source code
-  and object code form.
-
-  b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor
-  hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free
-  patent license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to
-  sell, import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such
-  Contributor, if any, in source code and object code form. This patent
-  license shall apply to the combination of the Contribution and the
-  Program if, at the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor,
-  such addition of the Contribution causes such combination to be
-  covered by the Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to
-  any other combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per
-  se is licensed hereunder.
-
-  c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants
-  the licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are
-  provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the
-  patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity. Each
-  Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims brought by
-  any other entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights
-  or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses
-  granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility
-  to secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any. For
-  example, if a third party patent license is required to allow
-  Recipient to distribute the Program, it is Recipient's responsibility
-  to acquire that license before distributing the Program.
-
-  d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has
-  sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the
-  copyright license set forth in this Agreement.
+      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
+          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
+          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
+          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
+          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
+          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
+          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
+          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
+          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
+          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
+          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
+          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
+          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
+          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
+          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
+          as modifying the License.
 
-  3. REQUIREMENTS
+      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
+      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
+      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
+      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
+      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
+      the conditions stated in this License.
 
-  A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form
-  under its own license agreement, provided that:
+   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
+      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
+      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
+      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
+      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
+      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
+      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
 
-  a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement;
-    and
+   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
+      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
+      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
+      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
 
-  b) its license agreement:
+   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
+      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
+      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
+      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
+      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
+      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
+      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
+      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
+      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
 
-  i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all
-  warranties and conditions, express and implied, including warranties
-  or conditions of title and non-infringement, and implied warranties or
-  conditions of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose;
+   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
+      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
+      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
+      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
+      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
+      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
+      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
+      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
+      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
+      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
+      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
 
-  ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all
-  liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental
-  and consequential damages, such as lost profits;
+   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
+      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
+      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
+      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
+      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
+      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
+      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
+      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
+      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
+      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
 
-  iii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement
-  are offered by that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and
+   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
 
-  iv) states that source code for the Program is available from
-  such Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a
-  reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily used for software
-  exchange.
+   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.
 
-  When the Program is made available in source code form:
+      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following
+      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "[]"
+      replaced with your own identifying information. (Don't include
+      the brackets!)  The text should be enclosed in the appropriate
+      comment syntax for the file format. We also recommend that a
+      file or class name and description of purpose be included on the
+      same "printed page" as the copyright notice for easier
+      identification within third-party archives.
 
-  a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and 
+   Copyright [yyyy] [name of copyright owner]
 
-  b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of
-  the Program.
+   Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the "License");

+--------------------------------------------------
+Library: com.fasterxml.jackson.core:jackson-core v2.9.5

+License: Apache-2.0
 
-  Commercial distributors of software may accept certain
-  responsibilities with respect to end users, business partners and the
-  like. While this license is intended to facilitate the commercial use
-  of the Program, the Contributor who includes the Program in a
-  commercial product offering should do so in a manner which does not
-  create potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a
-  Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering,
-  such Contributor ("Commercial Contributor") hereby agrees to defend
-  and indemnify every other Contributor ("Indemnified Contributor")
-  against any losses, damages and costs (collectively "Losses") arising
-  from claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third party
-  against the Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the acts
-  or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in connection with its
-  distribution of the Program in a commercial product offering. The
-  obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses
-  relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property
-  infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a)
-  promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in writing of such claim,
-  and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control, and cooperate with
-  the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any related settlement
-  negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in any such
-  claim at its own expense.

-  For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial
-  product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial
-  Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance
-  claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance
-  claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility
-  alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to
-  defend claims against the other Contributors related to those
-  performance claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other
-  Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor
-  must pay those damages.

-  respect to a patent applicable to software (including a cross-claim or
-  counterclaim in a lawsuit), then any patent licenses granted by that
-  Contributor to such Recipient under this Agreement shall terminate as

-             Version 2, June 1991
-
-   Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
-                         59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA
-   Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
-   of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
-
-            Preamble
-
-    The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
-  freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
-  License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
-  software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This
-  General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
-  Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
-  using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
-  the GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to
-  your programs, too.
-
-    When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
-  price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
-  have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
-  this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
-  if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
-  in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.
-
-    To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
-  anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
-  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
-  distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.
-
-    For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
-  gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
-  you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
-  source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
-  rights.
-
-    We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
-  (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
-  distribute and/or modify the software.
-
-    Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
-  that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
-  software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
-  want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
-  that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
-  authors' reputations.
-
-    Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
-  patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
-  program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
-  program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
-  patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.
-
-    The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
-  modification follow.
-
-          GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
-     TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
-
-    0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains
-  a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
-  under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below,
-  refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"
-  means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
-  that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
-  either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
-  language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
-  the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".
-
-  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
-  covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
-  running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
-  is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
-  Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).
-  Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.
-
-    1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
-  source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
-  conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
-  copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
-  notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
-  and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
-  along with the Program.
-
-  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
-  you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.
-
-    2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
-  of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
-  distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
-  above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
-
-      a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
-      stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
-
-      b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
-      whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
-      part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
-      parties under the terms of this License.
-
-      c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
-      when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
-      interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
-      announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
-      notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
-      a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
-      these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
-      License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
-      does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
-      the Program is not required to print an announcement.)
-
-  These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
-  identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
-  and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
-  themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
-  sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
-  distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
-  on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
-  this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
-  entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.
-
-  Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
-  your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
-  exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
-  collective works based on the Program.
-
-  In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
-  with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
-  a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
-  the scope of this License.
-
-    3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
-  under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
-  Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:
-
-      a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
-      source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
-      1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,
-
-      b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
-      years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
-      cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
-      machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
-      distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
-      customarily used for software interchange; or,
-
-      c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
-      to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
-      allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
-      received the program in object code or executable form with such
-      an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)
-
-  The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
-  making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source
-  code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
-  associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
-  control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a
-  special exception, the source code distributed need not include
-  anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
-  form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
-  operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
-  itself accompanies the executable.
-
-  If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
-  access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
-  access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
-  distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
-  compelled to copy the source along with the object code.
-
-    4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
-  except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
-  otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
-  void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
-  However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
-  this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
-  parties remain in full compliance.
-
-    5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
-  signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
-  distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are
-  prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
-  modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
-  Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
-  all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
-  the Program or works based on it.
-
-    6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
-  Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
-  original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
-  these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
-  restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
-  You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
-  this License.
-
-    7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
-  infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
-  conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
-  otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
-  excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
-  distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
-  License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
-  may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent
-  license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
-  all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
-  the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
-  refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.
-
-  If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
-  any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
-  apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
-  circumstances.
-
-  It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
-  patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
-  such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
-  integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
-  implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
-  generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
-  through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
-  system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
-  to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
-  impose that choice.
-
-  This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
-  be a consequence of the rest of this License.
-
-    8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
-  certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
-  original copyright holder who places the Program under this License
-  may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
-  those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
-  countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
-  the limitation as if written in the body of this License.
-
-    9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
-  of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
-  be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
-  address new problems or concerns.
-
-  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
-  specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
-  later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions
-  either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
-  Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of
-  this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
-  Foundation.
-
-    10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
-  programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author
-  to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free
-  Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
-  make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals
-  of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and
-  of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.
-
-            NO WARRANTY
-
-    11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
-  FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN
-  OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
-  PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
-  OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
-  MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS
-  TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
-  PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
-  REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
-
-    12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
-  WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
-  REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
-  INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
-  OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
-  TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY
-  YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
-  PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
-  POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
+      "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
+      and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.
 
-           END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
-
-The complete text of the GNU Lesser General Public License 2.1 is as follows:
-
-        GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
-             Version 2.1, February 1999
-
-   Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
-       59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA
-   Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
-   of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
-
-  [This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL.  It also counts
-   as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence
-   the version number 2.1.]
-
-            Preamble
-
-    The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
-  freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
-  Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change
-  free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.
-
-    This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some
-  specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the
-  Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You
-  can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether
-  this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better
-  strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.
-
-    When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,
-  not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that
-  you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge
-  for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get
-  it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of
-  it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do
-  these things.
-
-    To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
-  distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these
-  rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for
-  you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.
-
-    For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis
-  or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave
-  you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source
-  code.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide
-  complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them
-  with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling
-  it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.
-
-    We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the
-  library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal
-  permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.
-
-    To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that
-  there is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is
-  modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know
-  that what they have is not the original version, so that the original
-  author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be
-  introduced by others.
-
-    Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of
-  any free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot
-  effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a
-  restrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that
-  any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be
-  consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.
-
-    Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the
-  ordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser
-  General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and
-  is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use
-  this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those
-  libraries into non-free programs.
-
-    When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using
-  a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a
-  combined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary
-  General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the
-  entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General
-  Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with
-  the library.
-
-    We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it
-  does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General
-  Public License.  It also provides other free software developers Less
-  of an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages
-  are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many
-  libraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain
-  special circumstances.
-
-    For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to
-  encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes
-  a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must be
-  allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free
-  library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this
-  case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free
-  software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.
-
-    In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free
-  programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of
-  free software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in
-  non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU
-  operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating
-  system.
-
-    Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the
-  users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is
-  linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run
-  that program using a modified version of the Library.
-
-    The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
-  modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a
-  "work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library".  The
-  former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must
-  be combined with the library in order to run.
-
-        GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
-     TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
-
-    0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other
-  program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or
-  other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of
-  this Lesser General Public License (also called "this License").
-  Each licensee is addressed as "you".
-
-    A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data
-  prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs
-  (which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.
-
-    The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work
-  which has been distributed under these terms.  A "work based on the
-  Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under
-  copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a
-  portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated
-  straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is
-  included without limitation in the term "modification".)
-
-    "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for
-  making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means
-  all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated
-  interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation
-  and installation of the library.
-
-    Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
-  covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
-  running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from
-  such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based
-  on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for
-  writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does
-  and what the program that uses the Library does.
-  
-    1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's
-  complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that
-  you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an
-  appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact
-  all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any
-  warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the
-  Library.
-
-    You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,
-  and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a
-  fee.
-
-    2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion
-  of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and
-  distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
-  above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
-
-      a) The modified work must itself be a software library.
-
-      b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices
-      stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
-
-      c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no
-      charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.
-
-      d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a
-      table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses
-      the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility
-      is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,
-      in the event an application does not supply such function or
-      table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of
-      its purpose remains meaningful.
-
-      (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has
-      a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the
-      application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any
-      application-supplied function or table used by this function must
-      be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square
-      root function must still compute square roots.)
-
-  These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
-  identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,
-  and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
-  themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
-  sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
-  distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
-  on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
-  this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
-  entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote
-  it.
-
-  Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
-  your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
-  exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
-  collective works based on the Library.
-
-  In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library
-  with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of
-  a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
-  the scope of this License.
-
-    3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public
-  License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do
-  this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so
-  that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,
-  instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the
-  ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify
-  that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in
-  these notices.
-
-    Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for
-  that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all
-  subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.
-
-    This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of
-  the Library into a program that is not a library.
-
-    4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or
-  derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form
-  under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany
-  it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which
-  must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a
-  medium customarily used for software interchange.
-
-    If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy
-  from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the
-  source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to
-  distribute the source code, even though third parties are not
-  compelled to copy the source along with the object code.
-
-    5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the
-  Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or
-  linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library".  Such a
-  work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and
-  therefore falls outside the scope of this License.
-
-    However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library
-  creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it
-  contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the
-  library".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.
-  Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.
-
-    When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file
-  that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a
-  derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.
-  Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be
-  linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The
-  threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.
-
-    If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data
-  structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline
-  functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object
-  file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative
-  work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the
-  Library will still fall under Section 6.)
-
-    Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may
-  distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.
-  Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,
-  whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.
-
-    6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or
-  link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a
-  work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work
-  under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit
-  modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse
-  engineering for debugging such modifications.
-
-    You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the
-  Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by
-  this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work
-  during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the
-  copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference
-  directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one
-  of these things:
-
-      a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding
-      machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever
-      changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under
-      Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked
-      with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that
-      uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the
-      user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified
-      executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood
-      that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the
-      Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application
-      to use the modified definitions.)
-
-      b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the
-      Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a
-      copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,
-      rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)
-      will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if
-      the user installs one, as long as the modified version is
-      interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.
-
-      c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at
-      least three years, to give the same user the materials
-      specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more
-      than the cost of performing this distribution.
-
-      d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy
-      from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above
-      specified materials from the same place.
-
-      e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these
-      materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.
-
-    For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the
-  Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for
-  reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,
-  the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is
-  normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
-  components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
-  which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies
-  the executable.
-
-    It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license
-  restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally
-  accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot
-  use both them and the Library together in an executable that you
-  distribute.
-
-    7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
-  Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library
-  facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined
-  library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on
-  the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise
-  permitted, and provided that you do these two things:
-
-      a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work
-      based on the Library, uncombined with any other library
-      facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the
-      Sections above.
-
-      b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact
-      that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining
-      where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.
-
-    8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute
-  the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any
-  attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or
-  distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your
-  rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,
-  or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses
-  terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.
-
-    9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
-  signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
-  distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are
-  prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
-  modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the
-  Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
-  all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
-  the Library or works based on it.
-
-    10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the
-  Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
-  original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library
-  subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
-  restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
-  You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with
-  this License.
-
-    11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
-  infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
-  conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
-  otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
-  excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
-  distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
-  License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
-  may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent
-  license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by
-  all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
-  the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
-  refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.
-
-  If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
-  particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,
-  and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.
-
-  It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
-  patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
-  such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
-  integrity of the free software distribution system which is
-  implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
-  generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
-  through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
-  system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
-  to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
-  impose that choice.
-
-  This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
-  be a consequence of the rest of this License.
-
-    12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in
-  certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
-  original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add
-  an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,
-  so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus
-  excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if
-  written in the body of this License.
-
-    13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
-  versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.
-  Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,
-  but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
-
-  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library
-  specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and
-  "any later version", you have the option of following the terms and
-  conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
-  the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a
-  license version number, you may choose any version ever published by
-  the Free Software Foundation.
-
-    14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free
-  programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,
-  write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is
-  copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free
-  Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our
-  decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status
-  of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing
-  and reuse of software generally.
-
-            NO WARRANTY
-
-    15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
-  WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
-  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
-  OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY
-  KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE
-  IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
-  PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE
-  LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME
-  THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
-
-    16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
-  WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
-  AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU
-  FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR
-  CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE
-  LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING
-  RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A
-  FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF
-  SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
-  DAMAGES.
-
-           END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
-
-             How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries
-
-    If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest
-  possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that
-  everyone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting
-  redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the
-  ordinary General Public License).
-
-    To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.  It is
-  safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
-  convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
-  "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
-
-      <one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
-      Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>
-
-      This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or
-      modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public
-      License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either
-      version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.
-
-      This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
-      but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
-      MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU
-      Lesser General Public License for more details.
-
-      You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public
-      License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software
-      Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA
-
-  Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
-
-  You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
-  school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the library, if
-  necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:

-The following licenses cover code other than JRuby which is included with JRuby.
-
-Licenses listed below include:
-
-* GNU General Public License version 3
-* Apache 2.0 License
-* BSD License
-* Apache Software License Version 1.1
-* MIT License
-
-The complete text of the GNU General Public License version 3 is as follows:
-
-          GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
-             Version 3, 29 June 2007
-
-   Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>
-   Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
-   of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
-
-            Preamble
-
-    The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
-  software and other kinds of works.
-
-    The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed
-  to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,
-  the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to
-  share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free
-  software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the
-  GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to
-  any other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to
-  your programs, too.
-
-    When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
-  price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
-  have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
-  them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
-  want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
-  free programs, and that you know you can do these things.
-
-    To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you
-  these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have
-  certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if
-  you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.
-
-    For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
-  gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same
-  freedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive
-  or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they
-  know their rights.
-
-    Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:
-  (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License
-  giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.
-
-    For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains
-  that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and
-  authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as
-  changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to
-  authors of previous versions.
-
-    Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run
-  modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer
-  can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of
-  protecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic
-  pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to
-  use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we
-  have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those
-  products.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we
-  stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions
-  of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.
+      "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
+      the copyright owner that is granting the License.
 
-    Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.
-  States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of
-  software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to
-  avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could
-  make it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that
-  patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.
-
-    The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
-  modification follow.
+      "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
+      other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
+      control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
+      "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
+      direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
+      otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
+      outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.
 
-             TERMS AND CONDITIONS
+      "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
+      exercising permissions granted by this License.
 
-    0. Definitions.
+      "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
+      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
+      source, and configuration files.
 
-    "This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.
+      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
+      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
+      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
+      and conversions to other media types.
 
-    "Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of
-  works, such as semiconductor masks.
- 
-    "The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this
-  License.  Each licensee is addressed as "you".  "Licensees" and
-  "recipients" may be individuals or organizations.
-
-    To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work
-  in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an
-  exact copy.  The resulting work is called a "modified version" of the
-  earlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work.
-
-    A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based
-  on the Program.
-
-    To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without
-  permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for
-  infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a
-  computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,
-  distribution (with or without modification), making available to the
-  public, and in some countries other activities as well.
-
-    To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other
-  parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through
-  a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.
-
-    An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices"
-  to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible
-  feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)
-  tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the
-  extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the
-  work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If
-  the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a
-  menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.
-
-    1. Source Code.
-
-    The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work
-  for making modifications to it.  "Object code" means any non-source
-  form of a work.
-
-    A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an official
-  standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of
-  interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that
-  is widely used among developers working in that language.
-
-    The "System Libraries" of an executable work include anything, other
-  than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of
-  packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major
-  Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that
-  Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an
-  implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A
-  "Major Component", in this context, means a major essential component
-  (kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system
-  (if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to
-  produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.
-
-    The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all
-  the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable
-  work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to
-  control those activities.  However, it does not include the work's
-  System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free
-  programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but
-  which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source
-  includes interface definition files associated with source files for
-  the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically
-  linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,
-  such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those
-  subprograms and other parts of the work.
-
-    The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users
-  can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding
-  Source.
-
-    The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that
-  same work.
-
-    2. Basic Permissions.
-
-    All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of
-  copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated
-  conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited
-  permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a
-  covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its
-  content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your
-  rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.
-
-    You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not
-  convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains
-  in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose
-  of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you
-  with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with
-  the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do
-  not control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works
-  for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction
-  and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of
-  your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.
-
-    Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under
-  the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10
-  makes it unnecessary.
-
-    3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.
-
-    No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological
-  measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article
-  11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or
-  similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such
-  measures.
-
-    When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid
-  circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention
-  is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to
-  the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or
-  modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's
-  users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of
-  technological measures.
-
-    4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.
-
-    You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you
-  receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
-  appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;
-  keep intact all notices stating that this License and any
-  non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;
-  keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all
-  recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.
-
-    You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,
-  and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.
-
-    5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.
-
-    You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to
-  produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the
-  terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
-
-      a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified
-      it, and giving a relevant date.
-
-      b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is
-      released under this License and any conditions added under section
-      7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to
-      "keep intact all notices".
-
-      c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this
-      License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This
-      License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7
-      additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,
-      regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no
-      permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not
-      invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.
-
-      d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display
-      Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive
-      interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your
-      work need not make them do so.
-
-    A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent
-  works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,
-  and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,
-  in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an
-  "aggregate" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not
-  used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users
-  beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work
-  in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other
-  parts of the aggregate.
-
-    6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.
-
-    You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms
-  of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the
-  machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,
-  in one of these ways:
-
-      a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
-      (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the
-      Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium
-      customarily used for software interchange.
-
-      b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
-      (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a
-      written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as
-      long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product
-      model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a
-      copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the
-      product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical
-      medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no
-      more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this
-      conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the
-      Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.
-
-      c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the
-      written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This
-      alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and
-      only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord
-      with subsection 6b.
-
-      d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated
-      place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the
-      Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no
-      further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the
-      Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to
-      copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source
-      may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)
-      that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain
-      clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the
-      Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the
-      Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is
-      available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.
-
-      e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided
-      you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding
-      Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no
-      charge under subsection 6d.
-
-    A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded
-  from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be
-  included in conveying the object code work.
-
-    A "User Product" is either (1) a "consumer product", which means any
-  tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,
-  or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation
-  into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,
-  doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular
-  product received by a particular user, "normally used" refers to a
-  typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status
-  of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user
-  actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product
-  is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial
-  commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent
-  the only significant mode of use of the product.
-
-    "Installation Information" for a User Product means any methods,
-  procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install
-  and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from
-  a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must
-  suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object
-  code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because
-  modification has been made.
-
-    If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or
-  specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as
-  part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the
-  User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a
-  fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the
-  Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied
-  by the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply
-  if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install
-  modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has
-  been installed in ROM).
-
-    The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a
-  requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates
-  for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for
-  the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a
-  network may be denied when the modification itself materially and
-  adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and
-  protocols for communication across the network.
-
-    Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,
-  in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly
-  documented (and with an implementation available to the public in
-  source code form), and must require no special password or key for
-  unpacking, reading or copying.
-
-    7. Additional Terms.
-
-    "Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of this
-  License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.
-  Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall
-  be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent
-  that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions
-  apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately
-  under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by
-  this License without regard to the additional permissions.
-
-    When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option
-  remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of
-  it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own
-  removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place
-  additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,
-  for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.
-
-    Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you
-  add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of
-  that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:
-
-      a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the
-      terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or
-
-      b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or
-      author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal
-      Notices displayed by works containing it; or
-
-      c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or
-      requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in
-      reasonable ways as different from the original version; or
-
-      d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or
-      authors of the material; or
-
-      e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some
-      trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or
-
-      f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that
-      material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of
-      it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for
-      any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on
-      those licensors and authors.
-
-    All other non-permissive additional terms are considered "further
-  restrictions" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you
-  received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is
-  governed by this License along with a term that is a further
-  restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains
-  a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this
-  License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms
-  of that license document, provided that the further restriction does
-  not survive such relicensing or conveying.
-
-    If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you
-  must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the
-  additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating
-  where to find the applicable terms.
-
-    Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the
-  form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;
-  the above requirements apply either way.
-
-    8. Termination.
-
-    You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly
-  provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or
-  modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under
-  this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third
-  paragraph of section 11).
-
-    However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your
-  license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
-  provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and
-  finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright
-  holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means
-  prior to 60 days after the cessation.
-
-    Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
-  reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
-  violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
-  received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that
-  copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after
-  your receipt of the notice.
-
-    Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the
-  licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under
-  this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently
-  reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same
-  material under section 10.
-
-    9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.
-
-    You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or
-  run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work
-  occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission
-  to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,
-  nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or
-  modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do
-  not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a
-  covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.
-
-    10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.
-
-    Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically
-  receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and
-  propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible
-  for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.
-
-    An "entity transaction" is a transaction transferring control of an
-  organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an
-  organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered
-  work results from an entity transaction, each party to that
-  transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever
-  licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could
-  give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the
-  Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if
-  the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.
-
-    You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the
-  rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may
-  not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of
-  rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation
-  (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that
-  any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for
-  sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.
-
-    11. Patents.
-
-    A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this
-  License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The
-  work thus licensed is called the contributor's "contributor version".
-
-    A contributor's "essential patent claims" are all patent claims
-  owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or
-  hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted
-  by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,
-  but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a
-  consequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For
-  purposes of this definition, "control" includes the right to grant
-  patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of
-  this License.
-
-    Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free
-  patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to
-  make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and
-  propagate the contents of its contributor version.
-
-    In the following three paragraphs, a "patent license" is any express
-  agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent
-  (such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to
-  sue for patent infringement).  To "grant" such a patent license to a
-  party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a
-  patent against the party.
-
-    If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,
-  and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone
-  to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a
-  publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,
-  then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so
-  available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the
-  patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner
-  consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent
-  license to downstream recipients.  "Knowingly relying" means you have
-  actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the
-  covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work
-  in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that
-  country that you have reason to believe are valid.
-  
-    If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or
-  arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a
-  covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties
-  receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify
-  or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license
-  you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered
-  work and works based on it.
-
-    A patent license is "discriminatory" if it does not include within
-  the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is
-  conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are
-  specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered
-  work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is
-  in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment
-  to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying
-  the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the
-  parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory
-  patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work
-  conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily
-  for and in connection with specific products or compilations that
-  contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,
-  or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.
-
-    Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting
-  any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may
-  otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.
-
-    12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.
-
-    If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
-  otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
-  excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a
-  covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
-  License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may
-  not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you
-  to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey
-  the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this
-  License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.
-
-    13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.
-
-    Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have
-  permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed
-  under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single
-  combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this
-  License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,
-  but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,
-  section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the
-  combination as such.
-
-    14. Revised Versions of this License.
-
-    The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of
-  the GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
-  be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
-  address new problems or concerns.
-
-    Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the
-  Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General
-  Public License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the
-  option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered
-  version or of any later version published by the Free Software
-  Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the
-  GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published
-  by the Free Software Foundation.
-
-    If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future
-  versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's
-  public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you
-  to choose that version for the Program.
-
-    Later license versions may give you additional or different
-  permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any
-  author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a
-  later version.
-
-    15. Disclaimer of Warranty.
-
-    THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY
-  APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT
-  HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY
-  OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,
-  THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
-  PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM
-  IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF
-  ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
-
-    16. Limitation of Liability.
-
-    IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
-  WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS
-  THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY
-  GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE
-  USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF
-  DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD
-  PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),
-  EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF
-  SUCH DAMAGES.
-
-    17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.
-
-    If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided
-  above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,
-  reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates
-  an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the
-  Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a
-  copy of the Program in return for a fee.
-
-           END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
-
-        How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
-
-    If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
-  possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
-  free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.
-
-    To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
-  to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
-  state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
-  the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
-
-      <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
-      Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>
-
-      This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify
-      it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
-      the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or
-      (at your option) any later version.
-
-      This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
-      but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
-      MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
-      GNU General Public License for more details.
-
-      You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
-      along with this program.  If not, see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.
-
-  Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
-
-    If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short
-  notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:
-
-      <program>  Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>
-      This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.
-      This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
-      under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.
-
-  The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate
-  parts of the General Public License.  Of course, your program's commands
-  might be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an "about box".
-
-    You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,
-  if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if necessary.
-  For more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see
-  <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.
-
-    The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program
-  into proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you
-  may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with
-  the library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General
-  Public License instead of this License.  But first, please read
-  <http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/why-not-lgpl.html>.

-     (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
-
-     "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
-     form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
-     editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications

-     submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
-     or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
-     the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"

-     designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
-
-     "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
-     on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
-     subsequently incorporated within the Work.
-
-  2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
-     this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
-     worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
-     copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
-     publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
-     Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
-
-  3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
-     this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,

-     by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
-     Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
-     with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
-     institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
-     cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
-     or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
-     or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
-     granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
-     as of the date such litigation is filed.
-
-  4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
-     Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
-     modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
-     meet the following conditions:
-
-     (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
-         Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
-
-     (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
-         stating that You changed the files; and
-
-     (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
-         that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
-         attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
-         excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
-         the Derivative Works; and
-
-     (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
-         distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
-         include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
-         within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
-         pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
-         of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
-         as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
-         documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
-         within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
-         wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
-         of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
-         do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
-         notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
-         or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
-         that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
-         as modifying the License.
-
-     You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
-     may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
-     for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
-     for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
-     reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
-     the conditions stated in this License.
-
-  5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
-     any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
-     by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
-     this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
-     Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
-     the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
-     with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
-
-  6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
-     names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
-     except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
-     origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
-
-  7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
-     agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
-     Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
-     WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
-     implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
-     of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
-     PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
-     appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
-     risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
-
-  8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
-     whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
-     unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
-     negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
-     liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
-     incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
-     result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
-     Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
-     work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
-     other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
-     has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
-
-  9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
-     the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
-     and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
-     or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
-     License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
-     on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
-     of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
-     defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
-     incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
-     of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

-
-The complete text of the Eclipse Public License v1.0 is as follows:
-
-  Eclipse Public License - v 1.0
-  
-  THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS ECLIPSE PUBLIC
-  LICENSE ("AGREEMENT"). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM
-  CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT’S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.
-  
-  1. DEFINITIONS
-  
-  "Contribution" means:
-  
-  a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial code and documentation
-  distributed under this Agreement, and
-  b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:
-  
-  i) changes to the Program, and
-  
-  ii) additions to the Program;
-  
-  where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from and are
-  distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution 'originates' from a
-  Contributor if it was added to the Program by such Contributor itself or anyone
-  acting on such Contributor’s behalf. Contributions do not include additions to
-  the Program which: (i) are separate modules of software distributed in
-  conjunction with the Program under their own license agreement, and (ii) are not
-  derivative works of the Program.
-  
-  "Contributor" means any person or entity that distributes the Program.
-  
-  "Licensed Patents " mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which are
-  necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone or when
-  combined with the Program.
-  
-  "Program" means the Contributions distributed in accordance with this Agreement.
-  
-  "Recipient" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement,
-  including all Contributors.
-  
-  2. GRANT OF RIGHTS
-  
-  a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants
-  Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to
-  reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform,
-  distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, and such
-  derivative works, in source code and object code form.
-  
-  b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants
-  Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under Licensed
-  Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise transfer the
-  Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in source code and object code form.
-  This patent license shall apply to the combination of the Contribution and the
-  Program if, at the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such
-  addition of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the
-  Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other combinations
-  which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is licensed hereunder.
-  
-  c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the licenses to
-  its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are provided by any
-  Contributor that the Program does not infringe the patent or other intellectual
-  property rights of any other entity. Each Contributor disclaims any liability to
-  Recipient for claims brought by any other entity based on infringement of
-  intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the
-  rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole
-  responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any.
-  For example, if a third party patent license is required to allow Recipient to
-  distribute the Program, it is Recipient’s responsibility to acquire that license
-  before distributing the Program.
-  
-  d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient copyright
-  rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright license set forth in
-  this Agreement.
-  
-  3. REQUIREMENTS
-  
-  A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form under its
-  own license agreement, provided that:
-  
-  a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and
-  
-  b) its license agreement:
-  
-  i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties and
-  conditions, express and implied, including warranties or conditions of title and
-  non-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and
-  fitness for a particular purpose;
-  
-  ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability for
-  damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and consequential
-  damages, such as lost profits;
-  
-  iii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are offered by
-  that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and
-  
-  iv) states that source code for the Program is available from such Contributor,
-  and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable manner on or through a
-  medium customarily used for software exchange.
-  
-  When the Program is made available in source code form:
-  
-  a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and
-  b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the Program.
-  
-  Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained within the
-  Program.
-  
-  Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its Contribution, if
-  any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent Recipients to identify the
-  originator of the Contribution.
-  
-  4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION
-  
-  Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with
-  respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this license is
-  intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the Contributor who
-  includes the Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a manner
-  which does not create potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if
-  a Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering, such
-  Contributor ("Commercial Contributor") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify
-  every other Contributor ("Indemnified Contributor") against any losses, damages
-  and costs (collectively "Losses") arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal
-  actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified Contributor to the
-  extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in
-  connection with its distribution of the Program in a commercial product
-  offering. The obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses
-  relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement. In order
-  to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial
-  Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to
-  control, and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any
-  related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in
-  any such claim at its own expense.
-  
-  For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial product
-  offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor. If that
-  Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, or offers warranties
-  related to Product X, those performance claims and warranties are such
-  Commercial Contributor’s responsibility alone. Under this section, the
-  Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims against the other
-  Contributors related to those performance claims and warranties, and if a court
-  requires any other Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial
-  Contributor must pay those damages.
-  
-  5. NO WARRANTY
-  
-  EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN
-  "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR
-  IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE,
-  NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each
-  Recipient is solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using and
-  distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with its exercise of
-  rights under this Agreement , including but not limited to the risks and costs
-  of program errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data,
-  programs or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.
-  
-  6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY
-  
-  EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY
-  CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL,
-  SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST
-  PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT,
-  STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY
-  OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS
-  GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
-  
-  7. GENERAL
-  
-  If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under applicable
-  law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the
-  terms of this Agreement, and without further action by the parties hereto, such
-  provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such
-  provision valid and enforceable.
-  
-  If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity (including a
-  cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program itself
-  (excluding combinations of the Program with other software or hardware)
-  infringes such Recipient’s patent(s), then such Recipient’s rights granted under
-  Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.
-  
-  All Recipient’s rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails to
-  comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement and does
-  not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after becoming aware of
-  such noncompliance. If all Recipient’s rights under this Agreement terminate,
-  Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the Program as soon as
-  reasonably practicable. However, Recipient’s obligations under this Agreement
-  and any licenses granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and
-  survive.
-  
-  Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement, but in
-  order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and may only be
-  modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward reserves the right to
-  publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement from time to time.
-  No one other than the Agreement Steward has the right to modify this Agreement.
-  The Eclipse Foundation is the initial Agreement Steward. The Eclipse Foundation
-  may assign the responsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable
-  separate entity. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a
-  distinguishing version number. The Program (including Contributions) may always
-  be distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which it was
-  received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is published,
-  Contributor may elect to distribute the Program (including its Contributions)
-  under the new version. Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b)
-  above, Recipient receives no rights or licenses to the intellectual property of
-  any Contributor under this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication,
-  estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly granted under
-  this Agreement are reserved.
-  
-  This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and the
-  intellectual property laws of the United States of America. No party to this
-  Agreement will bring a legal action under this Agreement more than one year
-  after the cause of action arose. Each party waives its rights to a jury trial in
-  any resulting litigation.

+          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
+          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of

+          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside

+      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
+
+   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
+      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
+      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the

+      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
+      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
+
+   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
+      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,

+      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
+      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
+      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
+
+   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
+      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
+      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
+      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
+      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
+      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
+      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,

+      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
+      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

-
-   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION

-      source, and configuration files.
-
-      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
-      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
-      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
-      and conversions to other media types.
-
-      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
-      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
-      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
-      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
-
-      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
-      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
-      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
-      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
-      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
-      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
-      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
-
-      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
-      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
-      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
-      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
-      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
-      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
-      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
-      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
-      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,

-      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
-      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
-      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
-
-      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
-      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
-      subsequently incorporated within the Work.
-
-   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
-      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
-      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
-      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
-      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
-      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
-
-   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
-      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
-      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
-      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
-      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,

-      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
-      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
-      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
-      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
-      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
-      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
-      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
-      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
-      as of the date such litigation is filed.
-
-   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
-      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
-      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
-      meet the following conditions:
-
-      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
-          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
-
-      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
-          stating that You changed the files; and
-
-      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
-          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
-          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
-          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
-          the Derivative Works; and
-
-      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
-          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
-          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
-          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
-          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
-          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
-          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
-          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
-          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
-          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
-          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
-          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
-          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
-          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
-          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
-          as modifying the License.
-
-      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
-      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
-      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
-      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
-      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
-      the conditions stated in this License.
-
-   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
-      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
-      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
-      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
-      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
-      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
-      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
-
-   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
-      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
-      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
-      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
-
-   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
-      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
-      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
-      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
-      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions

-
-      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
-      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the

-      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain

-      as of the date such litigation is filed.

-          the Derivative Works; and

-          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
-          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
-          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
-          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
-          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
-          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
-          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and

-          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
-          as modifying the License.
-
-      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and

-      the conditions stated in this License.
-
-   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
-      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
-      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
-      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
-      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
-      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
-      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
-
-   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
-      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
-      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
-      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
-
-   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
-      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
-      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
-      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
-      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
-      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
-      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
-      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
-      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
-
-   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
-      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
-      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
-      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
-      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
-      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
-      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
-      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
-      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
-      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
-      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
-
-   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
-      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
-      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
-      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
-      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
-      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf

-
-6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
-   names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
-   except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
-   origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
-
-7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or

-   WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
-   implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
-   of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
-   PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
-   appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
-   risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
-
-8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,

-   has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

-   the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
-   and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
-   or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
-   License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
-   on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
-   of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
-   defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
-   incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
-   of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

+          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not

-  "Licensed Patents" mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor
-  which are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its
-  Contribution alone or when combined with the Program.
+      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
+      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
+      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
+      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
+      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
+      the conditions stated in this License.
 
-  "Program" means the Contributions distributed in accordance with
-  this Agreement.
+   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
+      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
+      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
+      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
+      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
+      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
+      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
 
-  "Recipient" means anyone who receives the Program under this
-  Agreement, including all Contributors.
+   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
+      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
+      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
+      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
 
-  2. GRANT OF RIGHTS
+   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
+      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
+      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
+      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
+      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
+      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
+      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
+      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
+      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
 
-      a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor
-         hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide,
-         royalty-free copyright license to reproduce, prepare
-         derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform,
-         distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such
-         Contributor, if any, and such derivative works, in source
-         code and object code form.
-
-      b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor
-         hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide,
-         royalty-free patent license under Licensed Patents to make,
-         use, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise transfer the
-         Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in source code and
-         object code form. This patent license shall apply to the
-         combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at the
-         time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such
-         addition of the Contribution causes such combination to be
-         covered by the Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not
-         apply to any other combinations which include the
-         Contribution. No hardware per se is licensed hereunder.
-
-      c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants
-         the licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no
-         assurances are provided by any Contributor that the Program
-         does not infringe the patent or other intellectual property
-         rights of any other entity. Each Contributor disclaims any
-         liability to Recipient for claims brought by any other entity
-         based on infringement of intellectual property rights or
-         otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and
-         licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes
-         sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual property
-         rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party patent
-         license is required to allow Recipient to distribute the
-         Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that
-         license before distributing the Program.
-
-      d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has
-         sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to
-         grant the copyright license set forth in this Agreement.
+   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
+      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
+      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
+      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
+      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
+      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
+      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
+      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
+      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
+      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
+      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
 
-  3. REQUIREMENTS
+   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
+      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
+      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
+      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
+      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
+      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
+      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
+      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
+      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
+      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
 
-  A Contributor  may choose to  distribute the Program in  object code
-  form under its own license agreement, provided that:
+   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
 
-      a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and
+   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.
 
-      b) its license agreement:
+      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following
+      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "[]"
+      replaced with your own identifying information. (Don't include
+      the brackets!)  The text should be enclosed in the appropriate
+      comment syntax for the file format. We also recommend that a
+      file or class name and description of purpose be included on the
+      same "printed page" as the copyright notice for easier
+      identification within third-party archives.
 
-          i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all
-             warranties and conditions, express and implied, including
-             warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement,
-             and implied warranties or conditions of merchantability
-             and fitness for a particular purpose;

-          ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all
-              liability for damages, including direct, indirect,
-              special, incidental and consequential damages, such as
-              lost profits;

+   you may not use this file except in compliance with the License.
+   You may obtain a copy of the License at

-               Agreement are offered by that Contributor alone and not
-               by any other party; and
+       http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0
 
-          iv) states that source code for the Program is available
-              from such Contributor, and informs licensees how to

+License: Apache-2.0
 
-  Commercial distributors of software may accept certain
-  responsibilities with respect to end users, business partners and
-  the like. While this license is intended to facilitate the
-  commercial use of the Program, the Contributor who includes the
-  Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a manner
-  which does not create potential liability for other Contributors.
-  Therefore, if a Contributor includes the Program in a commercial
-  product offering, such Contributor ("Commercial Contributor") hereby
-  agrees to defend and indemnify every other Contributor ("Indemnified
-  Contributor") against any losses, damages and costs (collectively
-  "Losses") arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal actions
-  brought by a third party against the Indemnified Contributor to the
-  extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial
-  Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program in a
-  commercial product offering. The obligations in this section do not
-  apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged
-  intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an
-  Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial
-  Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial
-  Contributor to control, and cooperate with the Commercial
-  Contributor in, the defense and any related settlement negotiations.
-  The Indemnified Contributor may participate in any such claim at its
-  own expense.

-  For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial
-  product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial
-  Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance
-  claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance
-  claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's
-  responsibility alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor
-  would have to defend claims against the other Contributors related
-  to those performance claims and warranties, and if a court requires
-  any other Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial
-  Contributor must pay those damages.

+      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
+      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
+      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
+      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
+      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
+      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
 
-  a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial code and
-    documentation distributed under this Agreement, and
+      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
+      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
+      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
+      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner

+      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
+      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
+      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You

+      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
+      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
+      as of the date such litigation is filed.
 
-  where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate
-  from and are distributed by that particular Contributor. A
-  Contribution 'originates' from a Contributor if it was added to the
-  Program by such Contributor itself or anyone acting on such
-  Contributor's behalf. Contributions do not include additions to the
-  Program which: (i) are separate modules of software distributed in
-  conjunction with the Program under their own license agreement,

-  "Contributor" means any person or entity that distributes the Program.
+      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
+          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
 
-  "Licensed Patents " mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor
-  which are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution
-  alone or when combined with the Program.
+      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
+          stating that You changed the files; and
 
-  "Program" means the Contributions distributed in accordance with this Agreement.
+      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
+          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
+          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
+          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
+          the Derivative Works; and
 
-  "Recipient" means anyone who receives the Program under this
-  Agreement, including all Contributors.
+      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
+          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
+          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
+          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
+          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
+          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
+          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
+          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
+          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
+          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
+          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
+          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
+          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
+          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
+          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
+          as modifying the License.
 
-  2. GRANT OF RIGHTS
+      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
+      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
+      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
+      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
+      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
+      the conditions stated in this License.
 
-  a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor
-  hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free
-  copyright license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly
-  display, publicly perform, distribute and sublicense the Contribution
-  of such Contributor, if any, and such derivative works, in source code
-  and object code form.
-
-  b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor
-  hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free
-  patent license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to
-  sell, import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such
-  Contributor, if any, in source code and object code form. This patent
-  license shall apply to the combination of the Contribution and the
-  Program if, at the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor,
-  such addition of the Contribution causes such combination to be
-  covered by the Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to
-  any other combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per
-  se is licensed hereunder.
-
-  c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants
-  the licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are
-  provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the
-  patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity. Each
-  Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims brought by
-  any other entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights
-  or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses
-  granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility
-  to secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any. For
-  example, if a third party patent license is required to allow
-  Recipient to distribute the Program, it is Recipient's responsibility
-  to acquire that license before distributing the Program.
-
-  d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has
-  sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the
-  copyright license set forth in this Agreement.
+   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
+      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
+      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
+      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.

-  4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION
 
-  Commercial distributors of software may accept certain
-  responsibilities with respect to end users, business partners and the
-  like. While this license is intended to facilitate the commercial use
-  of the Program, the Contributor who includes the Program in a
-  commercial product offering should do so in a manner which does not
-  create potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a
-  Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering,
-  such Contributor ("Commercial Contributor") hereby agrees to defend
-  and indemnify every other Contributor ("Indemnified Contributor")
-  against any losses, damages and costs (collectively "Losses") arising
-  from claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third party
-  against the Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the acts
-  or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in connection with its
-  distribution of the Program in a commercial product offering. The
-  obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses
-  relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property
-  infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a)
-  promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in writing of such claim,
-  and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control, and cooperate with
-  the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any related settlement
-  negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in any such
-  claim at its own expense.

-  For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial
-  product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial
-  Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance
-  claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance
-  claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility
-  alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to
-  defend claims against the other Contributors related to those
-  performance claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other
-  Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor
-  must pay those damages.

-The complete text of the GNU General Public License v2 is as follows:
-
-          GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
-             Version 2, June 1991
-
-   Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
-                         59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA
-   Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
-   of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
-
-            Preamble
-
-    The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
-  freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
-  License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
-  software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This
-  General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
-  Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
-  using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
-  the GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to
-  your programs, too.
-
-    When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
-  price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
-  have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
-  this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
-  if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
-  in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.
-
-    To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
-  anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
-  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
-  distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.
-
-    For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
-  gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
-  you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
-  source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
-  rights.
-
-    We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
-  (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
-  distribute and/or modify the software.
-
-    Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
-  that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
-  software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
-  want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
-  that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
-  authors' reputations.
-
-    Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
-  patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
-  program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
-  program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
-  patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.
-
-    The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
-  modification follow.
-
-          GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
-     TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
-
-    0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains
-  a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
-  under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below,
-  refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"
-  means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
-  that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
-  either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
-  language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
-  the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".
-
-  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
-  covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
-  running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
-  is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
-  Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).
-  Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.
-
-    1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
-  source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
-  conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
-  copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
-  notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
-  and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
-  along with the Program.
-
-  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
-  you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.
-
-    2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
-  of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
-  distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
-  above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
-
-      a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
-      stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
-
-      b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
-      whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
-      part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
-      parties under the terms of this License.
-
-      c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
-      when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
-      interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
-      announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
-      notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
-      a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
-      these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
-      License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
-      does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
-      the Program is not required to print an announcement.)
-
-  These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
-  identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
-  and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
-  themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
-  sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
-  distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
-  on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
-  this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
-  entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.
-
-  Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
-  your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
-  exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
-  collective works based on the Program.
-
-  In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
-  with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
-  a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
-  the scope of this License.
-
-    3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
-  under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
-  Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:
-
-      a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
-      source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
-      1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,
-
-      b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
-      years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
-      cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
-      machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
-      distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
-      customarily used for software interchange; or,
-
-      c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
-      to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
-      allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
-      received the program in object code or executable form with such
-      an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)
-
-  The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
-  making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source
-  code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
-  associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
-  control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a
-  special exception, the source code distributed need not include
-  anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
-  form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
-  operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
-  itself accompanies the executable.
-
-  If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
-  access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
-  access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
-  distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
-  compelled to copy the source along with the object code.
-
-    4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
-  except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
-  otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
-  void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
-  However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
-  this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
-  parties remain in full compliance.
-
-    5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
-  signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
-  distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are
-  prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
-  modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
-  Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
-  all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
-  the Program or works based on it.
-
-    6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
-  Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
-  original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
-  these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
-  restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
-  You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
-  this License.
-
-    7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
-  infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
-  conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
-  otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
-  excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
-  distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
-  License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
-  may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent
-  license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
-  all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
-  the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
-  refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.
-
-  If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
-  any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
-  apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
-  circumstances.
-
-  It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
-  patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
-  such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
-  integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
-  implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
-  generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
-  through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
-  system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
-  to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
-  impose that choice.
-
-  This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
-  be a consequence of the rest of this License.
-
-    8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
-  certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
-  original copyright holder who places the Program under this License
-  may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
-  those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
-  countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
-  the limitation as if written in the body of this License.
-
-    9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
-  of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
-  be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
-  address new problems or concerns.
-
-  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
-  specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
-  later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions
-  either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
-  Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of
-  this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
-  Foundation.
-
-    10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
-  programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author
-  to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free
-  Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
-  make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals
-  of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and
-  of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.
-
-            NO WARRANTY
-
-    11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
-  FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN
-  OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
-  PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
-  OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
-  MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS
-  TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
-  PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
-  REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
-
-    12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
-  WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
-  REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
-  INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
-  OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
-  TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY
-  YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
-  PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
-  POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
+   "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
+   the copyright owner that is granting the License.

-            Preamble
-
-    The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
-  freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
-  Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change
-  free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.
-
-    This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some
-  specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the
-  Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You
-  can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether
-  this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better
-  strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.
-
-    When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,
-  not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that
-  you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge
-  for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get
-  it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of
-  it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do
-  these things.
-
-    To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
-  distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these
-  rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for
-  you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.
-
-    For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis
-  or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave
-  you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source
-  code.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide
-  complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them
-  with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling
-  it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.
-
-    We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the
-  library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal
-  permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.
-
-    To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that
-  there is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is
-  modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know
-  that what they have is not the original version, so that the original
-  author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be
-  introduced by others.
-
-    Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of
-  any free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot
-  effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a
-  restrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that
-  any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be
-  consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.
-
-    Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the
-  ordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser
-  General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and
-  is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use
-  this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those
-  libraries into non-free programs.
-
-    When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using
-  a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a
-  combined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary
-  General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the
-  entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General
-  Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with
-  the library.
-
-    We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it
-  does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General
-  Public License.  It also provides other free software developers Less
-  of an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages
-  are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many
-  libraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain
-  special circumstances.
-
-    For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to
-  encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes
-  a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must be
-  allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free
-  library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this
-  case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free
-  software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.
-
-    In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free
-  programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of
-  free software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in
-  non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU
-  operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating
-  system.
-
-    Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the
-  users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is
-  linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run
-  that program using a modified version of the Library.
-
-    The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
-  modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a
-  "work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library".  The
-  former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must
-  be combined with the library in order to run.
-
-        GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
-     TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
-
-    0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other
-  program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or
-  other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of
-  this Lesser General Public License (also called "this License").
-  Each licensee is addressed as "you".
-
-    A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data
-  prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs
-  (which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.
-
-    The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work
-  which has been distributed under these terms.  A "work based on the
-  Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under
-  copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a
-  portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated
-  straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is
-  included without limitation in the term "modification".)
-
-    "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for
-  making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means
-  all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated
-  interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation
-  and installation of the library.
-
-    Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
-  covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
-  running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from
-  such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based
-  on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for
-  writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does
-  and what the program that uses the Library does.
-  
-    1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's
-  complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that
-  you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an
-  appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact
-  all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any
-  warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the
-  Library.
-
-    You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,
-  and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a
-  fee.
-
-    2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion
-  of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and
-  distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
-  above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
-
-      a) The modified work must itself be a software library.
-
-      b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices
-      stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
-
-      c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no
-      charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.
-
-      d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a
-      table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses
-      the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility
-      is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,
-      in the event an application does not supply such function or
-      table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of
-      its purpose remains meaningful.
-
-      (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has
-      a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the
-      application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any
-      application-supplied function or table used by this function must
-      be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square
-      root function must still compute square roots.)
-
-  These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
-  identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,
-  and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
-  themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
-  sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
-  distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
-  on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
-  this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
-  entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote
-  it.
-
-  Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
-  your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
-  exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
-  collective works based on the Library.
-
-  In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library
-  with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of
-  a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
-  the scope of this License.
-
-    3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public
-  License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do
-  this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so
-  that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,
-  instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the
-  ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify
-  that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in
-  these notices.
-
-    Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for
-  that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all
-  subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.
-
-    This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of
-  the Library into a program that is not a library.
-
-    4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or
-  derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form
-  under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany
-  it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which
-  must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a
-  medium customarily used for software interchange.
-
-    If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy
-  from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the
-  source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to
-  distribute the source code, even though third parties are not
-  compelled to copy the source along with the object code.
-
-    5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the
-  Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or
-  linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library".  Such a
-  work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and
-  therefore falls outside the scope of this License.
-
-    However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library
-  creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it
-  contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the
-  library".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.
-  Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.
-
-    When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file
-  that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a
-  derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.
-  Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be
-  linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The
-  threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.
-
-    If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data
-  structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline
-  functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object
-  file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative
-  work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the
-  Library will still fall under Section 6.)
-
-    Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may
-  distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.
-  Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,
-  whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.
-
-    6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or
-  link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a
-  work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work
-  under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit
-  modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse
-  engineering for debugging such modifications.
-
-    You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the
-  Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by
-  this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work
-  during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the
-  copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference
-  directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one
-  of these things:
-
-      a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding
-      machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever
-      changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under
-      Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked
-      with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that
-      uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the
-      user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified
-      executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood
-      that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the
-      Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application
-      to use the modified definitions.)
-
-      b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the
-      Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a
-      copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,
-      rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)
-      will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if
-      the user installs one, as long as the modified version is
-      interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.
-
-      c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at
-      least three years, to give the same user the materials
-      specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more
-      than the cost of performing this distribution.
-
-      d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy
-      from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above
-      specified materials from the same place.
-
-      e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these
-      materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.
-
-    For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the
-  Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for
-  reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,
-  the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is
-  normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
-  components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
-  which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies
-  the executable.
-
-    It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license
-  restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally
-  accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot
-  use both them and the Library together in an executable that you
-  distribute.
-
-    7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
-  Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library
-  facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined
-  library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on
-  the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise
-  permitted, and provided that you do these two things:
-
-      a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work
-      based on the Library, uncombined with any other library
-      facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the
-      Sections above.
-
-      b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact
-      that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining
-      where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.
-
-    8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute
-  the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any
-  attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or
-  distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your
-  rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,
-  or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses
-  terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.
-
-    9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
-  signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
-  distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are
-  prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
-  modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the
-  Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
-  all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
-  the Library or works based on it.
-
-    10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the
-  Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
-  original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library
-  subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
-  restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
-  You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with
-  this License.
-
-    11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
-  infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
-  conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
-  otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
-  excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
-  distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
-  License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
-  may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent
-  license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by
-  all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
-  the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
-  refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.
-
-  If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
-  particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,
-  and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.
-
-  It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
-  patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
-  such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
-  integrity of the free software distribution system which is
-  implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
-  generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
-  through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
-  system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
-  to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
-  impose that choice.
-
-  This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
-  be a consequence of the rest of this License.
-
-    12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in
-  certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
-  original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add
-  an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,
-  so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus
-  excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if
-  written in the body of this License.
-
-    13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
-  versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.
-  Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,
-  but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
-
-  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library
-  specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and
-  "any later version", you have the option of following the terms and
-  conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
-  the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a
-  license version number, you may choose any version ever published by
-  the Free Software Foundation.
-
-    14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free
-  programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,
-  write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is
-  copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free
-  Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our
-  decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status
-  of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing
-  and reuse of software generally.
-
-            NO WARRANTY
-
-    15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
-  WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
-  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
-  OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY
-  KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE
-  IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
-  PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE
-  LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME
-  THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
-
-    16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
-  WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
-  AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU
-  FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR
-  CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE
-  LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING
-  RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A
-  FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF
-  SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
-  DAMAGES.
-
-           END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
-
-             How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries
-
-    If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest
-  possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that
-  everyone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting
-  redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the
-  ordinary General Public License).
-
-    To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.  It is
-  safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
-  convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
-  "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
-
-      <one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
-      Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>
-
-      This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or
-      modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public
-      License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either
-      version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.
-
-      This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
-      but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
-      MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU
-      Lesser General Public License for more details.
-
-      You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public
-      License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software
-      Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA
-
-  Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
-
-  You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
-  school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the library, if
-  necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:
-
-    Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the

-* GNU General Public License version 3
-* Apache 2.0 License
-* BSD License
-* Apache Software License Version 1.1
-* MIT License
-
-The complete text of the GNU General Public License version 3 is as follows:
-
-          GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
-             Version 3, 29 June 2007
-
-   Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>
-   Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
-   of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
-
-            Preamble
-
-    The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
-  software and other kinds of works.
-
-    The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed
-  to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,
-  the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to
-  share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free
-  software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the
-  GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to
-  any other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to
-  your programs, too.
-
-    When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
-  price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
-  have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
-  them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
-  want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
-  free programs, and that you know you can do these things.
-
-    To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you
-  these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have
-  certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if
-  you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.
-
-    For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
-  gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same
-  freedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive
-  or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they
-  know their rights.
-
-    Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:
-  (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License
-  giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.
-
-    For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains
-  that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and
-  authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as
-  changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to
-  authors of previous versions.
-
-    Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run
-  modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer
-  can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of
-  protecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic
-  pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to
-  use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we
-  have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those
-  products.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we
-  stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions
-  of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.
+   "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
+   other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
+   control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
+   "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
+   direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
+   otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
+   outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.
+
+   "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
+   exercising permissions granted by this License.
 
-    Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.
-  States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of
-  software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to
-  avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could
-  make it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that
-  patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.
-
-    The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
-  modification follow.
+   "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
+   including but not limited to software source code, documentation
+   source, and configuration files.
 
-             TERMS AND CONDITIONS
+   "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
+   transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
+   not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
+   and conversions to other media types.
 
-    0. Definitions.
+   "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
+   Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
+   copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
+   (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
 
-    "This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.
+   "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
+   form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
+   editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
+   represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
+   of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
+   separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
+   the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
 
-    "Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of
-  works, such as semiconductor masks.
- 
-    "The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this
-  License.  Each licensee is addressed as "you".  "Licensees" and
-  "recipients" may be individuals or organizations.
-
-    To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work
-  in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an
-  exact copy.  The resulting work is called a "modified version" of the
-  earlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work.
-
-    A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based
-  on the Program.
-
-    To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without
-  permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for
-  infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a
-  computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,
-  distribution (with or without modification), making available to the
-  public, and in some countries other activities as well.
-
-    To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other
-  parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through
-  a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.
-
-    An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices"
-  to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible
-  feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)
-  tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the
-  extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the
-  work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If
-  the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a
-  menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.
-
-    1. Source Code.
-
-    The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work
-  for making modifications to it.  "Object code" means any non-source
-  form of a work.
-
-    A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an official
-  standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of
-  interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that
-  is widely used among developers working in that language.
-
-    The "System Libraries" of an executable work include anything, other
-  than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of
-  packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major
-  Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that
-  Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an
-  implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A
-  "Major Component", in this context, means a major essential component
-  (kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system
-  (if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to
-  produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.
-
-    The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all
-  the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable
-  work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to
-  control those activities.  However, it does not include the work's
-  System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free
-  programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but
-  which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source
-  includes interface definition files associated with source files for
-  the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically
-  linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,
-  such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those
-  subprograms and other parts of the work.
-
-    The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users
-  can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding
-  Source.
-
-    The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that
-  same work.
-
-    2. Basic Permissions.
-
-    All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of
-  copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated
-  conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited
-  permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a
-  covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its
-  content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your
-  rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.
-
-    You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not
-  convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains
-  in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose
-  of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you
-  with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with
-  the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do
-  not control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works
-  for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction
-  and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of
-  your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.
-
-    Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under
-  the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10
-  makes it unnecessary.
-
-    3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.
-
-    No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological
-  measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article
-  11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or
-  similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such
-  measures.
-
-    When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid
-  circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention
-  is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to
-  the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or
-  modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's
-  users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of
-  technological measures.
-
-    4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.
-
-    You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you
-  receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
-  appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;
-  keep intact all notices stating that this License and any
-  non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;
-  keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all
-  recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.
-
-    You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,
-  and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.
-
-    5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.
-
-    You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to
-  produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the
-  terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
-
-      a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified
-      it, and giving a relevant date.
-
-      b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is
-      released under this License and any conditions added under section
-      7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to
-      "keep intact all notices".
-
-      c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this
-      License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This
-      License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7
-      additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,
-      regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no
-      permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not
-      invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.
-
-      d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display
-      Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive
-      interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your
-      work need not make them do so.
-
-    A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent
-  works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,
-  and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,
-  in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an
-  "aggregate" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not
-  used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users
-  beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work
-  in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other
-  parts of the aggregate.
-
-    6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.
-
-    You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms
-  of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the
-  machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,
-  in one of these ways:
-
-      a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
-      (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the
-      Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium
-      customarily used for software interchange.
-
-      b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
-      (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a
-      written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as
-      long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product
-      model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a
-      copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the
-      product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical
-      medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no
-      more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this
-      conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the
-      Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.
-
-      c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the
-      written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This
-      alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and
-      only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord
-      with subsection 6b.
-
-      d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated
-      place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the
-      Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no
-      further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the
-      Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to
-      copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source
-      may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)
-      that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain
-      clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the
-      Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the
-      Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is
-      available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.
-
-      e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided
-      you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding
-      Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no
-      charge under subsection 6d.
-
-    A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded
-  from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be
-  included in conveying the object code work.
-
-    A "User Product" is either (1) a "consumer product", which means any
-  tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,
-  or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation
-  into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,
-  doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular
-  product received by a particular user, "normally used" refers to a
-  typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status
-  of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user
-  actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product
-  is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial
-  commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent
-  the only significant mode of use of the product.
-
-    "Installation Information" for a User Product means any methods,
-  procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install
-  and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from
-  a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must
-  suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object
-  code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because
-  modification has been made.
-
-    If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or
-  specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as
-  part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the
-  User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a
-  fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the
-  Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied
-  by the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply
-  if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install
-  modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has
-  been installed in ROM).
-
-    The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a
-  requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates
-  for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for
-  the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a
-  network may be denied when the modification itself materially and
-  adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and
-  protocols for communication across the network.
-
-    Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,
-  in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly
-  documented (and with an implementation available to the public in
-  source code form), and must require no special password or key for
-  unpacking, reading or copying.
-
-    7. Additional Terms.
-
-    "Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of this
-  License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.
-  Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall
-  be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent
-  that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions
-  apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately
-  under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by
-  this License without regard to the additional permissions.
-
-    When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option
-  remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of
-  it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own
-  removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place
-  additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,
-  for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.
-
-    Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you
-  add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of
-  that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:
-
-      a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the
-      terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or
-
-      b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or
-      author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal
-      Notices displayed by works containing it; or
-
-      c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or
-      requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in
-      reasonable ways as different from the original version; or
-
-      d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or
-      authors of the material; or
-
-      e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some
-      trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or
-
-      f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that
-      material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of
-      it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for
-      any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on
-      those licensors and authors.
-
-    All other non-permissive additional terms are considered "further
-  restrictions" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you
-  received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is
-  governed by this License along with a term that is a further
-  restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains
-  a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this
-  License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms
-  of that license document, provided that the further restriction does
-  not survive such relicensing or conveying.
-
-    If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you
-  must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the
-  additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating
-  where to find the applicable terms.
-
-    Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the
-  form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;
-  the above requirements apply either way.
-
-    8. Termination.
-
-    You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly
-  provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or
-  modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under
-  this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third
-  paragraph of section 11).
-
-    However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your
-  license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
-  provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and
-  finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright
-  holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means
-  prior to 60 days after the cessation.
-
-    Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
-  reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
-  violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
-  received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that
-  copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after
-  your receipt of the notice.
-
-    Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the
-  licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under
-  this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently
-  reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same
-  material under section 10.
-
-    9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.
-
-    You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or
-  run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work
-  occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission
-  to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,
-  nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or
-  modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do
-  not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a
-  covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.
-
-    10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.
-
-    Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically
-  receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and
-  propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible
-  for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.
-
-    An "entity transaction" is a transaction transferring control of an
-  organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an
-  organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered
-  work results from an entity transaction, each party to that
-  transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever
-  licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could
-  give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the
-  Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if
-  the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.
-
-    You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the
-  rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may
-  not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of
-  rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation
-  (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that
-  any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for
-  sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.
-
-    11. Patents.
-
-    A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this
-  License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The
-  work thus licensed is called the contributor's "contributor version".
-
-    A contributor's "essential patent claims" are all patent claims
-  owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or
-  hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted
-  by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,
-  but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a
-  consequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For
-  purposes of this definition, "control" includes the right to grant
-  patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of
-  this License.
-
-    Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free
-  patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to
-  make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and
-  propagate the contents of its contributor version.
-
-    In the following three paragraphs, a "patent license" is any express
-  agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent
-  (such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to
-  sue for patent infringement).  To "grant" such a patent license to a
-  party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a
-  patent against the party.
-
-    If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,
-  and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone
-  to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a
-  publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,
-  then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so
-  available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the
-  patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner
-  consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent
-  license to downstream recipients.  "Knowingly relying" means you have
-  actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the
-  covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work
-  in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that
-  country that you have reason to believe are valid.
-  
-    If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or
-  arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a
-  covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties
-  receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify
-  or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license
-  you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered
-  work and works based on it.
-
-    A patent license is "discriminatory" if it does not include within
-  the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is
-  conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are
-  specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered
-  work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is
-  in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment
-  to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying
-  the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the
-  parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory
-  patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work
-  conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily
-  for and in connection with specific products or compilations that
-  contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,
-  or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.
-
-    Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting
-  any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may
-  otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.
-
-    12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.
-
-    If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
-  otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
-  excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a
-  covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
-  License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may
-  not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you
-  to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey
-  the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this
-  License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.
-
-    13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.
-
-    Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have
-  permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed
-  under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single
-  combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this
-  License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,
-  but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,
-  section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the
-  combination as such.
-
-    14. Revised Versions of this License.
-
-    The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of
-  the GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
-  be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
-  address new problems or concerns.
-
-    Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the
-  Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General
-  Public License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the
-  option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered
-  version or of any later version published by the Free Software
-  Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the
-  GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published
-  by the Free Software Foundation.
-
-    If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future
-  versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's
-  public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you
-  to choose that version for the Program.
-
-    Later license versions may give you additional or different
-  permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any
-  author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a
-  later version.
-
-    15. Disclaimer of Warranty.
-
-    THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY
-  APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT
-  HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY
-  OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,
-  THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
-  PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM
-  IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF
-  ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
-
-    16. Limitation of Liability.
-
-    IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
-  WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS
-  THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY
-  GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE
-  USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF
-  DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD
-  PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),
-  EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF
-  SUCH DAMAGES.
-
-    17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.
-
-    If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided
-  above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,
-  reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates
-  an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the
-  Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a
-  copy of the Program in return for a fee.
-
-           END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
-
-        How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
-
-    If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
-  possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
-  free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.
-
-    To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
-  to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
-  state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
-  the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
-
-      <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
-      Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>
-
-      This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify
-      it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
-      the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or
-      (at your option) any later version.
-
-      This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
-      but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
-      MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
-      GNU General Public License for more details.
-
-      You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
-      along with this program.  If not, see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.
-
-  Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
-
-    If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short
-  notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:
-
-      <program>  Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>
-      This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.
-      This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
-      under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.
-
-  The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate
-  parts of the General Public License.  Of course, your program's commands
-  might be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an "about box".
-
-    You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,
-  if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if necessary.
-  For more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see
-  <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.
-
-    The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program
-  into proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you
-  may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with
-  the library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General
-  Public License instead of this License.  But first, please read
-  <http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/why-not-lgpl.html>.

-
-     "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
-     form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
-     editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications

-  2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
-     this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
-     worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable

-     by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
-     Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
-     with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
-     institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
-     cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
-     or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
-     or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
-     granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
-     as of the date such litigation is filed.
-
-  4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
-     Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
-     modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
-     meet the following conditions:
-
-     (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or

-
-     (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
-         stating that You changed the files; and
-
-     (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works

-         excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
-         the Derivative Works; and
-
-     (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
-         distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
-         include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
-         within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
-         pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
-         of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
-         as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
-         documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
-         within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
-         wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
-         of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
-         do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
-         notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside

-
-     You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
-     may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
-     for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
-     for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
-     reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
-     the conditions stated in this License.
-
-  5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
-     any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
-     by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
-     this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
-     Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
-     the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
-     with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
-
-  6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
-     names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
-     except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
-     origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
-
-  7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
-     agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
-     Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
-     WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
-     implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
-     of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
-     PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
-     appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
-     risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
-
-  8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
-     whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
-     unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
-     negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
-     liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
-     incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
-     result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
-     Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
-     work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
-     other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
-     has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
-
-  9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
-     the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
-     and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
-     or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
-     License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
-     on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
-     of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
-     defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
-     incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
-     of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

-
-The complete text of the Eclipse Public License v1.0 is as follows:
-
-  Eclipse Public License - v 1.0
-  
-  THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS ECLIPSE PUBLIC
-  LICENSE ("AGREEMENT"). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM
-  CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT’S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.
-  
-  1. DEFINITIONS
-  
-  "Contribution" means:
-  
-  a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial code and documentation
-  distributed under this Agreement, and
-  b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:
-  
-  i) changes to the Program, and
-  
-  ii) additions to the Program;
-  
-  where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from and are
-  distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution 'originates' from a
-  Contributor if it was added to the Program by such Contributor itself or anyone
-  acting on such Contributor’s behalf. Contributions do not include additions to
-  the Program which: (i) are separate modules of software distributed in
-  conjunction with the Program under their own license agreement, and (ii) are not
-  derivative works of the Program.
-  
-  "Contributor" means any person or entity that distributes the Program.
-  
-  "Licensed Patents " mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which are
-  necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone or when
-  combined with the Program.
-  
-  "Program" means the Contributions distributed in accordance with this Agreement.
-  
-  "Recipient" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement,
-  including all Contributors.
-  
-  2. GRANT OF RIGHTS
-  
-  a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants
-  Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to
-  reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform,
-  distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, and such
-  derivative works, in source code and object code form.
-  
-  b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants
-  Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under Licensed
-  Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise transfer the
-  Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in source code and object code form.
-  This patent license shall apply to the combination of the Contribution and the
-  Program if, at the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such
-  addition of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the
-  Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other combinations
-  which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is licensed hereunder.
-  
-  c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the licenses to
-  its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are provided by any
-  Contributor that the Program does not infringe the patent or other intellectual
-  property rights of any other entity. Each Contributor disclaims any liability to
-  Recipient for claims brought by any other entity based on infringement of
-  intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the
-  rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole
-  responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any.
-  For example, if a third party patent license is required to allow Recipient to
-  distribute the Program, it is Recipient’s responsibility to acquire that license
-  before distributing the Program.
-  
-  d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient copyright
-  rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright license set forth in
-  this Agreement.
-  
-  3. REQUIREMENTS
-  
-  A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form under its
-  own license agreement, provided that:
-  
-  a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and
-  
-  b) its license agreement:
-  
-  i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties and
-  conditions, express and implied, including warranties or conditions of title and
-  non-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and
-  fitness for a particular purpose;
-  
-  ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability for
-  damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and consequential
-  damages, such as lost profits;
-  
-  iii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are offered by
-  that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and
-  
-  iv) states that source code for the Program is available from such Contributor,
-  and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable manner on or through a
-  medium customarily used for software exchange.
-  
-  When the Program is made available in source code form:
-  
-  a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and
-  b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the Program.
-  
-  Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained within the
-  Program.
-  
-  Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its Contribution, if
-  any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent Recipients to identify the
-  originator of the Contribution.
-  
-  4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION
-  
-  Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with
-  respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this license is
-  intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the Contributor who
-  includes the Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a manner
-  which does not create potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if
-  a Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering, such
-  Contributor ("Commercial Contributor") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify
-  every other Contributor ("Indemnified Contributor") against any losses, damages
-  and costs (collectively "Losses") arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal
-  actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified Contributor to the
-  extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in
-  connection with its distribution of the Program in a commercial product
-  offering. The obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses
-  relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement. In order
-  to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial
-  Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to
-  control, and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any
-  related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in
-  any such claim at its own expense.
-  
-  For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial product
-  offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor. If that
-  Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, or offers warranties
-  related to Product X, those performance claims and warranties are such
-  Commercial Contributor’s responsibility alone. Under this section, the
-  Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims against the other
-  Contributors related to those performance claims and warranties, and if a court
-  requires any other Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial
-  Contributor must pay those damages.
-  
-  5. NO WARRANTY
-  
-  EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN
-  "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR
-  IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE,
-  NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each
-  Recipient is solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using and
-  distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with its exercise of
-  rights under this Agreement , including but not limited to the risks and costs
-  of program errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data,
-  programs or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.
-  
-  6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY
-  
-  EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY
-  CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL,
-  SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST
-  PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT,
-  STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY
-  OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS
-  GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
-  
-  7. GENERAL
-  
-  If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under applicable
-  law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the
-  terms of this Agreement, and without further action by the parties hereto, such
-  provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such
-  provision valid and enforceable.
-  
-  If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity (including a
-  cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program itself
-  (excluding combinations of the Program with other software or hardware)
-  infringes such Recipient’s patent(s), then such Recipient’s rights granted under
-  Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.
-  
-  All Recipient’s rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails to
-  comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement and does
-  not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after becoming aware of
-  such noncompliance. If all Recipient’s rights under this Agreement terminate,
-  Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the Program as soon as
-  reasonably practicable. However, Recipient’s obligations under this Agreement
-  and any licenses granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and
-  survive.
-  
-  Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement, but in
-  order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and may only be
-  modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward reserves the right to
-  publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement from time to time.
-  No one other than the Agreement Steward has the right to modify this Agreement.
-  The Eclipse Foundation is the initial Agreement Steward. The Eclipse Foundation
-  may assign the responsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable
-  separate entity. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a
-  distinguishing version number. The Program (including Contributions) may always
-  be distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which it was
-  received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is published,
-  Contributor may elect to distribute the Program (including its Contributions)
-  under the new version. Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b)
-  above, Recipient receives no rights or licenses to the intellectual property of
-  any Contributor under this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication,
-  estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly granted under
-  this Agreement are reserved.
-  
-  This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and the
-  intellectual property laws of the United States of America. No party to this
-  Agreement will bring a legal action under this Agreement more than one year
-  after the cause of action arose. Each party waives its rights to a jury trial in
-  any resulting litigation.

-   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION
-
-   1. Definitions.

-      "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
-      and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.
-
-      "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
-      the copyright owner that is granting the License.

-      other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
-      control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
-      "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
-      direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
-      otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the

-
-      "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
-      exercising permissions granted by this License.
-
-      "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
-      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
-      source, and configuration files.
-
-      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
-      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
-      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
-      and conversions to other media types.
-
-      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
-      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
-      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
-      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
-
-      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
-      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
-      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
-      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
-      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
-      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
-      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
-
-      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
-      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
-      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
-      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
-      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
-      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
-      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
-      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
-      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
-      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
-      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
-      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
-      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
-
-      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
-      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
-      subsequently incorporated within the Work.
-
-   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
-      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
-      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
-      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
-      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
-      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
-
-   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
-      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
-      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
-      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
-      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
-      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
-      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
-      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
-      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
-      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
-      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
-      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
-      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
-      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
-      as of the date such litigation is filed.
-
-   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
-      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
-      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
-      meet the following conditions:
-
-      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
-          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
-
-      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
-          stating that You changed the files; and
-
-      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
-          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
-          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
-          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
-          the Derivative Works; and
-
-      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
-          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
-          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
-          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
-          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
-          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
-          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
-          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
-          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
-          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
-          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
-          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
-          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
-          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
-          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
-          as modifying the License.
-
-      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
-      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
-      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
-      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
-      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
-      the conditions stated in this License.
-
-   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
-      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
-      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
-      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
-      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
-      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
-      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
-
-   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
-      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
-      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
-      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
-
-   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
-      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
-      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
-      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
-      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
-      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
-      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
-      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
-      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
-
-   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
-      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
-      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
-      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
-      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
-      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
-      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
-      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
-      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
-      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
-      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
-
-   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
-      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
-      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
-      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
-      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
-      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
-      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
-      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
-      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
-      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
-

-   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.
-
-      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following
-      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "[]"
-      replaced with your own identifying information. (Don't include

-
-The complete text of the Eclipse Public License is as follows:
-
-  Eclipse Public License - v 1.0
-
-  THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS ECLIPSE
-  PUBLIC LICENSE ("AGREEMENT"). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION
-  OF THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.
-
-  1. DEFINITIONS
-
-  "Contribution" means:
-
-      a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial code and
-         documentation distributed under this Agreement, and
-
-      b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:
-
-          i) changes to the Program, and
-
-          ii) additions to the Program;
-              where such changes and/or additions to the Program
-              originate from and are distributed by that particular
-              Contributor. A Contribution 'originates' from a
-              Contributor if it was added to the Program by such
-              Contributor itself or anyone acting on such
-              Contributor's behalf. Contributions do not include
-              additions to the Program which: (i) are separate modules
-              of software distributed in conjunction with the Program
-              under their own license agreement, and (ii) are not
-              derivative works of the Program.
-
-  "Contributor" means any person or entity that distributes the Program.
-
-  "Licensed Patents" mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor
-  which are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its
-  Contribution alone or when combined with the Program.
-
-  "Program" means the Contributions distributed in accordance with
-  this Agreement.
-
-  "Recipient" means anyone who receives the Program under this
-  Agreement, including all Contributors.
-
-  2. GRANT OF RIGHTS
-
-      a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor
-         hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide,
-         royalty-free copyright license to reproduce, prepare
-         derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform,
-         distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such
-         Contributor, if any, and such derivative works, in source
-         code and object code form.
-
-      b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor
-         hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide,
-         royalty-free patent license under Licensed Patents to make,
-         use, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise transfer the
-         Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in source code and
-         object code form. This patent license shall apply to the
-         combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at the
-         time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such
-         addition of the Contribution causes such combination to be
-         covered by the Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not
-         apply to any other combinations which include the
-         Contribution. No hardware per se is licensed hereunder.
-
-      c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants
-         the licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no
-         assurances are provided by any Contributor that the Program
-         does not infringe the patent or other intellectual property
-         rights of any other entity. Each Contributor disclaims any
-         liability to Recipient for claims brought by any other entity
-         based on infringement of intellectual property rights or
-         otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and
-         licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes
-         sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual property
-         rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party patent
-         license is required to allow Recipient to distribute the
-         Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that
-         license before distributing the Program.
-
-      d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has
-         sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to
-         grant the copyright license set forth in this Agreement.
-
-  3. REQUIREMENTS
-
-  A Contributor  may choose to  distribute the Program in  object code
-  form under its own license agreement, provided that:
-
-      a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and
-
-      b) its license agreement:
-
-          i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all
-             warranties and conditions, express and implied, including
-             warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement,
-             and implied warranties or conditions of merchantability
-             and fitness for a particular purpose;
-
-          ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all
-              liability for damages, including direct, indirect,
-              special, incidental and consequential damages, such as
-              lost profits;
-
-          iii) states that any provisions which differ from this
-               Agreement are offered by that Contributor alone and not
-               by any other party; and
-
-          iv) states that source code for the Program is available
-              from such Contributor, and informs licensees how to
-              obtain it in a reasonable manner on or through a medium
-              customarily used for software exchange.
-
-  When the Program is made available in source code form:
-
-      a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and
-
-      b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of
-         the Program.
-
-  Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained
-  within the Program.
-
-  Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its
-  Contribution, if any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent
-  Recipients to identify the originator of the Contribution.
-
-  4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION
-
-  Commercial distributors of software may accept certain
-  responsibilities with respect to end users, business partners and
-  the like. While this license is intended to facilitate the
-  commercial use of the Program, the Contributor who includes the
-  Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a manner
-  which does not create potential liability for other Contributors.
-  Therefore, if a Contributor includes the Program in a commercial
-  product offering, such Contributor ("Commercial Contributor") hereby
-  agrees to defend and indemnify every other Contributor ("Indemnified
-  Contributor") against any losses, damages and costs (collectively
-  "Losses") arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal actions
-  brought by a third party against the Indemnified Contributor to the
-  extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial
-  Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program in a
-  commercial product offering. The obligations in this section do not
-  apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged
-  intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an
-  Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial
-  Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial
-  Contributor to control, and cooperate with the Commercial
-  Contributor in, the defense and any related settlement negotiations.
-  The Indemnified Contributor may participate in any such claim at its
-  own expense.
-
-  For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial
-  product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial
-  Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance
-  claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance
-  claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's
-  responsibility alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor
-  would have to defend claims against the other Contributors related
-  to those performance claims and warranties, and if a court requires
-  any other Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial
-  Contributor must pay those damages.
-
-  5. NO WARRANTY
-
-  EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS
-  PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF
-  ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION,
-  ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT,
-  MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient
-  is solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using
-  and distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with
-  its exercise of rights under this Agreement , including but not
-  limited to the risks and costs of program errors, compliance with
-  applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs or equipment,
-  and unavailability or interruption of operations.
-
-  6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY
-
-  EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT
-  NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT,
-  INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES
-  (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON
-  ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR
-  TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF
-  THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS
-  GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
-  DAMAGES.
-
-  7. GENERAL
-
-  If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under
-  applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability
-  of the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further
-  action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to
-  the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and
-  enforceable.
-
-  If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity
-  (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that
-  the Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other
-  software or hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then
-  such Recipient's rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate
-  as of the date such litigation is filed.
-
-  All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it
-  fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this
-  Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of
-  time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's
-  rights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use
-  and distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable.
-  However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement and any
-  licenses granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue
-  and survive.
-
-  Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this
-  Agreement, but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is
-  copyrighted and may only be modified in the following manner. The
-  Agreement Steward reserves the right to publish new versions
-  (including revisions) of this Agreement from time to time. No one
-  other than the Agreement Steward has the right to modify this
-  Agreement. The Eclipse Foundation is the initial Agreement Steward.
-  The Eclipse Foundation may assign the responsibility to serve as the
-  Agreement Steward to a suitable separate entity. Each new version of
-  the Agreement will be given a distinguishing version number. The
-  Program (including Contributions) may always be distributed subject
-  to the version of the Agreement under which it was received. In
-  addition, after a new version of the Agreement is published,
-  Contributor may elect to distribute the Program (including its
-  Contributions) under the new version. Except as expressly stated in
-  Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no rights or
-  licenses to the intellectual property of any Contributor under this
-  Agreement, whether expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise.
-  All rights in the Program not expressly granted under this Agreement
-  are reserved.
-
-  This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and
-  the intellectual property laws of the United States of America. No
-  party to this Agreement will bring a legal action under this
-  Agreement more than one year after the cause of action arose. Each
-  party waives its rights to a jury trial in any resulting litigation.
-
-The complete text of the Common Public License is as follows:
-
-  Common Public License - v 1.0
-
-  THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS COMMON
-  PUBLIC LICENSE ("AGREEMENT"). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF
-  THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.
-
-  1. DEFINITIONS
-
-  "Contribution" means:
-
-  a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial code and
-    documentation distributed under this Agreement, and
-
-  b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:
-
-  i) changes to the Program, and
-
-  ii) additions to the Program;
-
-  where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate
-  from and are distributed by that particular Contributor. A
-  Contribution 'originates' from a Contributor if it was added to the
-  Program by such Contributor itself or anyone acting on such
-  Contributor's behalf. Contributions do not include additions to the
-  Program which: (i) are separate modules of software distributed in
-  conjunction with the Program under their own license agreement,
-  and (ii) are not derivative works of the Program.
-
-  "Contributor" means any person or entity that distributes the Program.
-
-  "Licensed Patents " mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor
-  which are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution
-  alone or when combined with the Program.
-
-  "Program" means the Contributions distributed in accordance with this Agreement.
-
-  "Recipient" means anyone who receives the Program under this
-  Agreement, including all Contributors.
-
-  2. GRANT OF RIGHTS
-
-  a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor
-  hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free
-  copyright license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly
-  display, publicly perform, distribute and sublicense the Contribution
-  of such Contributor, if any, and such derivative works, in source code
-  and object code form.
-
-  b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor
-  hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free
-  patent license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to
-  sell, import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such
-  Contributor, if any, in source code and object code form. This patent
-  license shall apply to the combination of the Contribution and the
-  Program if, at the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor,
-  such addition of the Contribution causes such combination to be
-  covered by the Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to
-  any other combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per
-  se is licensed hereunder.
-
-  c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants
-  the licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are
-  provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the
-  patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity. Each
-  Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims brought by
-  any other entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights
-  or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses
-  granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility
-  to secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any. For
-  example, if a third party patent license is required to allow
-  Recipient to distribute the Program, it is Recipient's responsibility
-  to acquire that license before distributing the Program.
-
-  d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has
-  sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the
-  copyright license set forth in this Agreement.
-
-  3. REQUIREMENTS
-
-  A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form
-  under its own license agreement, provided that:
-
-  a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement;
-    and
-
-  b) its license agreement:
-
-  i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all
-  warranties and conditions, express and implied, including warranties
-  or conditions of title and non-infringement, and implied warranties or
-  conditions of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose;
-
-  ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all
-  liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental
-  and consequential damages, such as lost profits;
-
-  iii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement
-  are offered by that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and
-
-  iv) states that source code for the Program is available from
-  such Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a
-  reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily used for software
-  exchange.
-
-  When the Program is made available in source code form:
-
-  a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and 
-
-  b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of
-  the Program.
-
-  Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained
-  within the Program.
-
-  Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its
-  Contribution, if any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent
-  Recipients to identify the originator of the Contribution.

-  against any losses, damages and costs (collectively "Losses") arising
-  from claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third party
-  against the Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the acts

-  distribution of the Program in a commercial product offering. The
-  obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses

-  promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in writing of such claim,
-  and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control, and cooperate with

-
-  7. GENERAL
-

-
-  If Recipient institutes patent litigation against a Contributor with
-  respect to a patent applicable to software (including a cross-claim or
-  counterclaim in a lawsuit), then any patent licenses granted by that
-  Contributor to such Recipient under this Agreement shall terminate as
-  of the date such litigation is filed. In addition, if Recipient
-  institutes patent litigation against any entity (including a

-            Preamble
-
-    The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
-  freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
-  License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
-  software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This
-  General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
-  Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
-  using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
-  the GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to
-  your programs, too.
-
-    When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
-  price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
-  have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
-  this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
-  if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
-  in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.
-
-    To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
-  anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
-  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
-  distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.
-
-    For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
-  gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
-  you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
-  source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
-  rights.
-
-    We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
-  (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
-  distribute and/or modify the software.
-
-    Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
-  that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
-  software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
-  want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
-  that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
-  authors' reputations.
-
-    Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
-  patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
-  program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
-  program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
-  patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.
-
-    The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
-  modification follow.
-
-          GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
-     TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
-
-    0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains
-  a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
-  under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below,
-  refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"
-  means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
-  that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
-  either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
-  language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
-  the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".
-
-  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
-  covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
-  running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
-  is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
-  Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).
-  Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.
-
-    1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
-  source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
-  conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
-  copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
-  notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
-  and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
-  along with the Program.
-
-  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
-  you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.
-
-    2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
-  of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
-  distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
-  above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
-
-      a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
-      stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
-
-      b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
-      whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
-      part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
-      parties under the terms of this License.
-
-      c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
-      when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
-      interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
-      announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
-      notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
-      a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
-      these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
-      License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
-      does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
-      the Program is not required to print an announcement.)
-
-  These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
-  identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
-  and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
-  themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
-  sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
-  distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
-  on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
-  this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
-  entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.
-
-  Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
-  your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
-  exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
-  collective works based on the Program.
-
-  In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
-  with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
-  a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
-  the scope of this License.
-
-    3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
-  under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
-  Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:
-
-      a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
-      source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
-      1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,
-
-      b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
-      years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
-      cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
-      machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
-      distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
-      customarily used for software interchange; or,
-
-      c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
-      to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
-      allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
-      received the program in object code or executable form with such
-      an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)
-
-  The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
-  making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source
-  code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
-  associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
-  control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a
-  special exception, the source code distributed need not include
-  anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
-  form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
-  operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
-  itself accompanies the executable.
-
-  If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
-  access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
-  access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
-  distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
-  compelled to copy the source along with the object code.
-
-    4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
-  except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
-  otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
-  void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
-  However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
-  this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
-  parties remain in full compliance.
-
-    5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
-  signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
-  distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are
-  prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
-  modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
-  Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
-  all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
-  the Program or works based on it.
-
-    6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
-  Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
-  original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
-  these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
-  restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
-  You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
-  this License.
-
-    7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
-  infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
-  conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
-  otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
-  excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
-  distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
-  License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
-  may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent
-  license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
-  all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
-  the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
-  refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.
-
-  If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
-  any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
-  apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
-  circumstances.
-
-  It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
-  patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
-  such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
-  integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
-  implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
-  generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
-  through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
-  system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
-  to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
-  impose that choice.
-
-  This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
-  be a consequence of the rest of this License.
-
-    8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
-  certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
-  original copyright holder who places the Program under this License
-  may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
-  those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
-  countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
-  the limitation as if written in the body of this License.
-
-    9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
-  of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
-  be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
-  address new problems or concerns.
-
-  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
-  specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
-  later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions
-  either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
-  Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of
-  this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
-  Foundation.
-
-    10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
-  programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author
-  to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free
-  Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
-  make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals
-  of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and
-  of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.
-
-            NO WARRANTY
-
-    11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
-  FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN
-  OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
-  PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
-  OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
-  MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS
-  TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
-  PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
-  REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
-
-    12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
-  WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
-  REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
-  INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
-  OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
-  TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY
-  YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
-  PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
-  POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
-
-           END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
-
-The complete text of the GNU Lesser General Public License 2.1 is as follows:
-
-        GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
-             Version 2.1, February 1999
-
-   Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
-       59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA
-   Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
-   of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
-
-  [This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL.  It also counts
-   as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence
-   the version number 2.1.]
-
-            Preamble
-
-    The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
-  freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
-  Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change
-  free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.
-
-    This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some
-  specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the
-  Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You
-  can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether
-  this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better
-  strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.
-
-    When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,
-  not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that
-  you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge
-  for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get
-  it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of
-  it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do
-  these things.
-
-    To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
-  distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these
-  rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for
-  you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.
-
-    For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis
-  or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave
-  you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source
-  code.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide
-  complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them
-  with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling
-  it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.
-
-    We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the
-  library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal
-  permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.
-
-    To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that
-  there is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is
-  modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know
-  that what they have is not the original version, so that the original
-  author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be
-  introduced by others.
-
-    Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of
-  any free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot
-  effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a
-  restrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that
-  any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be
-  consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.
-
-    Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the
-  ordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser
-  General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and
-  is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use
-  this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those
-  libraries into non-free programs.
-
-    When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using
-  a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a
-  combined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary
-  General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the
-  entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General
-  Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with
-  the library.
-
-    We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it
-  does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General
-  Public License.  It also provides other free software developers Less
-  of an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages
-  are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many
-  libraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain
-  special circumstances.
-
-    For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to
-  encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes
-  a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must be
-  allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free
-  library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this
-  case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free
-  software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.
-
-    In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free
-  programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of
-  free software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in
-  non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU
-  operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating
-  system.
-
-    Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the
-  users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is
-  linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run
-  that program using a modified version of the Library.
-
-    The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
-  modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a
-  "work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library".  The
-  former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must
-  be combined with the library in order to run.
-
-        GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
-     TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
-
-    0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other
-  program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or
-  other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of
-  this Lesser General Public License (also called "this License").
-  Each licensee is addressed as "you".
-
-    A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data
-  prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs
-  (which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.
-
-    The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work
-  which has been distributed under these terms.  A "work based on the
-  Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under
-  copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a
-  portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated
-  straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is
-  included without limitation in the term "modification".)
-
-    "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for
-  making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means
-  all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated
-  interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation
-  and installation of the library.
-
-    Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
-  covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
-  running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from
-  such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based
-  on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for
-  writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does
-  and what the program that uses the Library does.
-  
-    1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's
-  complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that
-  you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an
-  appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact
-  all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any
-  warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the
-  Library.
-
-    You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,
-  and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a
-  fee.
-
-    2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion
-  of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and
-  distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
-  above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
-
-      a) The modified work must itself be a software library.
-
-      b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices
-      stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
-
-      c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no
-      charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.
-
-      d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a
-      table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses
-      the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility
-      is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,
-      in the event an application does not supply such function or
-      table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of
-      its purpose remains meaningful.
-
-      (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has
-      a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the
-      application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any
-      application-supplied function or table used by this function must
-      be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square
-      root function must still compute square roots.)
-
-  These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
-  identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,
-  and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
-  themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
-  sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
-  distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
-  on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
-  this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
-  entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote
-  it.
-
-  Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
-  your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
-  exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
-  collective works based on the Library.
-
-  In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library
-  with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of
-  a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
-  the scope of this License.
-
-    3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public
-  License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do
-  this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so
-  that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,
-  instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the
-  ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify
-  that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in
-  these notices.
-
-    Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for
-  that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all
-  subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.
-
-    This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of
-  the Library into a program that is not a library.
-
-    4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or
-  derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form
-  under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany
-  it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which
-  must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a
-  medium customarily used for software interchange.
-
-    If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy
-  from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the
-  source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to
-  distribute the source code, even though third parties are not
-  compelled to copy the source along with the object code.
-
-    5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the
-  Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or
-  linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library".  Such a
-  work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and
-  therefore falls outside the scope of this License.
-
-    However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library
-  creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it
-  contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the
-  library".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.
-  Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.
-
-    When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file
-  that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a
-  derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.
-  Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be
-  linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The
-  threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.
-
-    If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data
-  structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline
-  functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object
-  file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative
-  work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the
-  Library will still fall under Section 6.)
-
-    Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may
-  distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.
-  Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,
-  whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.
-
-    6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or
-  link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a
-  work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work
-  under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit
-  modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse
-  engineering for debugging such modifications.
-
-    You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the
-  Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by
-  this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work
-  during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the
-  copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference
-  directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one
-  of these things:
-
-      a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding
-      machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever
-      changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under
-      Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked
-      with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that
-      uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the
-      user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified
-      executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood
-      that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the
-      Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application
-      to use the modified definitions.)
-
-      b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the
-      Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a
-      copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,
-      rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)
-      will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if
-      the user installs one, as long as the modified version is
-      interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.
-
-      c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at
-      least three years, to give the same user the materials
-      specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more
-      than the cost of performing this distribution.
-
-      d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy
-      from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above
-      specified materials from the same place.
-
-      e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these
-      materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.
-
-    For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the
-  Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for
-  reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,
-  the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is
-  normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
-  components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
-  which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies
-  the executable.
-
-    It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license
-  restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally
-  accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot
-  use both them and the Library together in an executable that you
-  distribute.
-
-    7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
-  Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library
-  facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined
-  library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on
-  the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise
-  permitted, and provided that you do these two things:
-
-      a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work
-      based on the Library, uncombined with any other library
-      facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the
-      Sections above.
-
-      b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact
-      that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining
-      where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.
-
-    8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute
-  the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any
-  attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or
-  distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your
-  rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,
-  or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses
-  terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.
-
-    9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
-  signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
-  distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are
-  prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
-  modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the
-  Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
-  all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
-  the Library or works based on it.
-
-    10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the
-  Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
-  original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library
-  subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
-  restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
-  You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with
-  this License.
-
-    11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
-  infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
-  conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
-  otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
-  excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
-  distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
-  License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
-  may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent
-  license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by
-  all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
-  the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
-  refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.
-
-  If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
-  particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,
-  and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.
-
-  It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
-  patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
-  such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
-  integrity of the free software distribution system which is
-  implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
-  generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
-  through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
-  system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
-  to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
-  impose that choice.
-
-  This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
-  be a consequence of the rest of this License.
-
-    12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in
-  certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
-  original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add
-  an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,
-  so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus
-  excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if
-  written in the body of this License.
-
-    13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
-  versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.
-  Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,
-  but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
-
-  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library
-  specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and
-  "any later version", you have the option of following the terms and
-  conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
-  the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a
-  license version number, you may choose any version ever published by
-  the Free Software Foundation.
-
-    14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free
-  programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,
-  write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is
-  copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free
-  Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our
-  decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status
-  of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing
-  and reuse of software generally.
-
-            NO WARRANTY
-
-    15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
-  WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
-  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
-  OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY
-  KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE
-  IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
-  PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE
-  LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME
-  THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
-
-    16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
-  WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
-  AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU
-  FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR
-  CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE
-  LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING
-  RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A
-  FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF
-  SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
-  DAMAGES.
-
-           END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
-
-             How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries
-
-    If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest
-  possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that
-  everyone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting
-  redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the
-  ordinary General Public License).
-
-    To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.  It is
-  safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
-  convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
-  "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
-
-      <one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
-      Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>
-
-      This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or
-      modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public
-      License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either
-      version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.
-
-      This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
-      but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
-      MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU
-      Lesser General Public License for more details.
-
-      You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public
-      License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software
-      Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA
-
-  Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
-
-  You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
-  school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the library, if
-  necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:
-
-    Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the

-The following licenses cover code other than JRuby which is included with JRuby.
-
-Licenses listed below include:
-
-* GNU General Public License version 3
-* Apache 2.0 License
-* BSD License
-* Apache Software License Version 1.1
-* MIT License
-
-The complete text of the GNU General Public License version 3 is as follows:
-
-          GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
-             Version 3, 29 June 2007
-
-   Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>
-   Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
-   of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
-
-            Preamble
-
-    The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
-  software and other kinds of works.
-
-    The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed
-  to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,
-  the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to
-  share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free
-  software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the
-  GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to
-  any other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to
-  your programs, too.
-
-    When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
-  price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
-  have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
-  them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
-  want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
-  free programs, and that you know you can do these things.
-
-    To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you
-  these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have
-  certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if
-  you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.
-
-    For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
-  gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same
-  freedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive
-  or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they
-  know their rights.
-
-    Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:
-  (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License
-  giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.
-
-    For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains
-  that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and
-  authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as
-  changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to
-  authors of previous versions.
-
-    Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run
-  modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer
-  can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of
-  protecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic
-  pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to
-  use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we
-  have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those
-  products.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we
-  stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions
-  of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.
-
-    Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.
-  States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of
-  software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to
-  avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could
-  make it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that
-  patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.
-
-    The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
-  modification follow.
-
-             TERMS AND CONDITIONS
-
-    0. Definitions.
-
-    "This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.
-
-    "Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of
-  works, such as semiconductor masks.
- 
-    "The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this
-  License.  Each licensee is addressed as "you".  "Licensees" and
-  "recipients" may be individuals or organizations.
-
-    To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work
-  in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an
-  exact copy.  The resulting work is called a "modified version" of the
-  earlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work.
-
-    A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based
-  on the Program.
-
-    To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without
-  permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for
-  infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a
-  computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,
-  distribution (with or without modification), making available to the
-  public, and in some countries other activities as well.
-
-    To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other
-  parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through
-  a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.
-
-    An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices"
-  to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible
-  feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)
-  tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the
-  extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the
-  work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If
-  the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a
-  menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.
-
-    1. Source Code.
-
-    The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work
-  for making modifications to it.  "Object code" means any non-source
-  form of a work.
-
-    A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an official
-  standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of
-  interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that
-  is widely used among developers working in that language.
-
-    The "System Libraries" of an executable work include anything, other
-  than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of
-  packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major
-  Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that
-  Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an
-  implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A
-  "Major Component", in this context, means a major essential component
-  (kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system
-  (if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to
-  produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.
-
-    The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all
-  the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable
-  work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to
-  control those activities.  However, it does not include the work's
-  System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free
-  programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but
-  which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source
-  includes interface definition files associated with source files for
-  the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically
-  linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,
-  such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those
-  subprograms and other parts of the work.
-
-    The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users
-  can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding
-  Source.
-
-    The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that
-  same work.
-
-    2. Basic Permissions.
-
-    All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of
-  copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated
-  conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited
-  permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a
-  covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its
-  content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your
-  rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.
-
-    You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not
-  convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains
-  in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose
-  of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you
-  with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with
-  the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do
-  not control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works
-  for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction
-  and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of
-  your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.
-
-    Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under
-  the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10
-  makes it unnecessary.
-
-    3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.
-
-    No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological
-  measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article
-  11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or
-  similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such
-  measures.
-
-    When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid
-  circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention
-  is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to
-  the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or
-  modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's
-  users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of
-  technological measures.
-
-    4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.
-
-    You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you
-  receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
-  appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;
-  keep intact all notices stating that this License and any
-  non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;
-  keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all
-  recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.
-
-    You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,
-  and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.
-
-    5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.
-
-    You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to
-  produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the
-  terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
-
-      a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified
-      it, and giving a relevant date.
-
-      b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is
-      released under this License and any conditions added under section
-      7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to
-      "keep intact all notices".
-
-      c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this
-      License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This
-      License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7
-      additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,
-      regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no
-      permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not
-      invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.
-
-      d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display
-      Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive
-      interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your
-      work need not make them do so.
-
-    A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent
-  works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,
-  and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,
-  in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an
-  "aggregate" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not
-  used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users
-  beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work
-  in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other
-  parts of the aggregate.
-
-    6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.
-
-    You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms
-  of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the
-  machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,
-  in one of these ways:
-
-      a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
-      (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the
-      Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium
-      customarily used for software interchange.
-
-      b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
-      (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a
-      written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as
-      long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product
-      model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a
-      copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the
-      product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical
-      medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no
-      more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this
-      conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the
-      Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.
-
-      c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the
-      written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This
-      alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and
-      only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord
-      with subsection 6b.
-
-      d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated
-      place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the
-      Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no
-      further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the
-      Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to
-      copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source
-      may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)
-      that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain
-      clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the
-      Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the
-      Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is
-      available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.
-
-      e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided
-      you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding
-      Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no
-      charge under subsection 6d.
-
-    A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded
-  from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be
-  included in conveying the object code work.
-
-    A "User Product" is either (1) a "consumer product", which means any
-  tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,
-  or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation
-  into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,
-  doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular
-  product received by a particular user, "normally used" refers to a
-  typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status
-  of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user
-  actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product
-  is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial
-  commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent
-  the only significant mode of use of the product.
-
-    "Installation Information" for a User Product means any methods,
-  procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install
-  and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from
-  a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must
-  suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object
-  code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because
-  modification has been made.
-
-    If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or
-  specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as
-  part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the
-  User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a
-  fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the
-  Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied
-  by the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply
-  if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install
-  modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has
-  been installed in ROM).
-
-    The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a
-  requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates
-  for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for
-  the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a
-  network may be denied when the modification itself materially and
-  adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and
-  protocols for communication across the network.
-
-    Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,
-  in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly
-  documented (and with an implementation available to the public in
-  source code form), and must require no special password or key for
-  unpacking, reading or copying.
-
-    7. Additional Terms.
-
-    "Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of this
-  License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.
-  Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall
-  be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent
-  that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions
-  apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately
-  under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by
-  this License without regard to the additional permissions.
-
-    When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option
-  remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of
-  it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own
-  removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place
-  additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,
-  for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.
-
-    Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you
-  add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of
-  that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:
-
-      a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the
-      terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or
-
-      b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or
-      author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal
-      Notices displayed by works containing it; or
-
-      c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or
-      requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in
-      reasonable ways as different from the original version; or
-
-      d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or
-      authors of the material; or
-
-      e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some
-      trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or
-
-      f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that
-      material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of
-      it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for
-      any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on
-      those licensors and authors.
-
-    All other non-permissive additional terms are considered "further
-  restrictions" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you
-  received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is
-  governed by this License along with a term that is a further
-  restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains
-  a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this
-  License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms
-  of that license document, provided that the further restriction does
-  not survive such relicensing or conveying.
-
-    If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you
-  must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the
-  additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating
-  where to find the applicable terms.
-
-    Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the
-  form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;
-  the above requirements apply either way.
-
-    8. Termination.
-
-    You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly
-  provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or
-  modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under
-  this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third
-  paragraph of section 11).
-
-    However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your
-  license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
-  provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and
-  finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright
-  holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means
-  prior to 60 days after the cessation.
-
-    Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
-  reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
-  violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
-  received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that
-  copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after
-  your receipt of the notice.
-
-    Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the
-  licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under
-  this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently
-  reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same
-  material under section 10.
-
-    9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.
-
-    You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or
-  run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work
-  occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission
-  to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,
-  nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or
-  modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do
-  not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a
-  covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.
-
-    10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.
-
-    Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically
-  receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and
-  propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible
-  for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.
-
-    An "entity transaction" is a transaction transferring control of an
-  organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an
-  organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered
-  work results from an entity transaction, each party to that
-  transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever
-  licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could
-  give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the
-  Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if
-  the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.
-
-    You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the
-  rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may
-  not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of
-  rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation
-  (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that
-  any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for
-  sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.
-
-    11. Patents.
-
-    A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this
-  License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The
-  work thus licensed is called the contributor's "contributor version".
-
-    A contributor's "essential patent claims" are all patent claims
-  owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or
-  hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted
-  by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,
-  but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a
-  consequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For
-  purposes of this definition, "control" includes the right to grant
-  patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of
-  this License.
-
-    Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free
-  patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to
-  make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and
-  propagate the contents of its contributor version.
-
-    In the following three paragraphs, a "patent license" is any express
-  agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent
-  (such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to
-  sue for patent infringement).  To "grant" such a patent license to a
-  party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a
-  patent against the party.
-
-    If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,
-  and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone
-  to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a
-  publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,
-  then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so
-  available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the
-  patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner
-  consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent
-  license to downstream recipients.  "Knowingly relying" means you have
-  actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the
-  covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work
-  in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that
-  country that you have reason to believe are valid.
-  
-    If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or
-  arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a
-  covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties
-  receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify
-  or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license
-  you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered
-  work and works based on it.
-
-    A patent license is "discriminatory" if it does not include within
-  the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is
-  conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are
-  specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered
-  work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is
-  in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment
-  to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying
-  the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the
-  parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory
-  patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work
-  conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily
-  for and in connection with specific products or compilations that
-  contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,
-  or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.
-
-    Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting
-  any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may
-  otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.
-
-    12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.
-
-    If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
-  otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
-  excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a
-  covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
-  License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may
-  not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you
-  to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey
-  the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this
-  License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.
-
-    13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.
-
-    Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have
-  permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed
-  under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single
-  combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this
-  License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,
-  but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,
-  section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the
-  combination as such.
-
-    14. Revised Versions of this License.
-
-    The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of
-  the GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
-  be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
-  address new problems or concerns.
-
-    Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the
-  Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General
-  Public License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the
-  option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered
-  version or of any later version published by the Free Software
-  Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the
-  GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published
-  by the Free Software Foundation.
-
-    If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future
-  versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's
-  public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you
-  to choose that version for the Program.
-
-    Later license versions may give you additional or different
-  permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any
-  author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a
-  later version.
-
-    15. Disclaimer of Warranty.
-
-    THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY
-  APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT
-  HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY
-  OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,
-  THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
-  PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM
-  IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF
-  ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
-
-    16. Limitation of Liability.
-
-    IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
-  WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS
-  THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY
-  GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE
-  USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF
-  DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD
-  PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),
-  EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF
-  SUCH DAMAGES.
-
-    17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.
-
-    If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided
-  above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,
-  reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates
-  an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the
-  Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a
-  copy of the Program in return for a fee.
-
-           END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
-
-        How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
-
-    If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
-  possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
-  free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.
-
-    To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
-  to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
-  state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
-  the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
-
-      <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
-      Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>
-
-      This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify
-      it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
-      the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or
-      (at your option) any later version.
-
-      This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
-      but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
-      MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
-      GNU General Public License for more details.
-
-      You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
-      along with this program.  If not, see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.
-
-  Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
-
-    If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short
-  notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:
-
-      <program>  Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>
-      This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.
-      This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
-      under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.
-
-  The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate
-  parts of the General Public License.  Of course, your program's commands
-  might be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an "about box".
-
-    You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,
-  if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if necessary.
-  For more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see
-  <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.
-
-    The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program
-  into proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you
-  may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with
-  the library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General
-  Public License instead of this License.  But first, please read
-  <http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/why-not-lgpl.html>.

-
-     "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
-     Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
-     copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
-     (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
-
-     "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
-     form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
-     editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
-     represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
-     of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
-     separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
-     the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
-
-     "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
-     the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
-     to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
-     submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
-     or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
-     the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
-     means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
-     to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
-     communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
-     and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
-     Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
-     excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
-     designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
-
-     "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
-     on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
-     subsequently incorporated within the Work.
-
-  2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
-     this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
-     worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
-     copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
-     publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
-     Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
-
-  3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
-     this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
-     worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
-     (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
-     use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
-     where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
-     by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
-     Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
-     with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
-     institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
-     cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
-     or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
-     or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
-     granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
-     as of the date such litigation is filed.
-
-  4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
-     Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
-     modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
-     meet the following conditions:
-
-     (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
-         Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
-
-     (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
-         stating that You changed the files; and
-
-     (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
-         that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
-         attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
-         excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
-         the Derivative Works; and
-
-     (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
-         distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
-         include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
-         within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
-         pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
-         of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
-         as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
-         documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
-         within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
-         wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
-         of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
-         do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
-         notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
-         or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
-         that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
-         as modifying the License.
-
-     You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
-     may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
-     for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
-     for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
-     reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
-     the conditions stated in this License.
-
-  5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
-     any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
-     by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
-     this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
-     Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
-     the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
-     with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
-
-  6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
-     names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
-     except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
-     origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
-
-  7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
-     agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
-     Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
-     WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
-     implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
-     of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
-     PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
-     appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
-     risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
-
-  8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
-     whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
-     unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
-     negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
-     liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
-     incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
-     result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
-     Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
-     work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
-     other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
-     has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
-
-  9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
-     the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
-     and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
-     or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this

-
-The complete text of the Eclipse Public License v1.0 is as follows:
-
-  Eclipse Public License - v 1.0
-  
-  THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS ECLIPSE PUBLIC
-  LICENSE ("AGREEMENT"). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM
-  CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT’S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.
-  
-  1. DEFINITIONS
-  
-  "Contribution" means:
-  
-  a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial code and documentation
-  distributed under this Agreement, and
-  b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:
-  
-  i) changes to the Program, and
-  
-  ii) additions to the Program;
-  
-  where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from and are
-  distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution 'originates' from a
-  Contributor if it was added to the Program by such Contributor itself or anyone
-  acting on such Contributor’s behalf. Contributions do not include additions to
-  the Program which: (i) are separate modules of software distributed in
-  conjunction with the Program under their own license agreement, and (ii) are not
-  derivative works of the Program.
-  
-  "Contributor" means any person or entity that distributes the Program.
-  
-  "Licensed Patents " mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which are
-  necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone or when
-  combined with the Program.
-  
-  "Program" means the Contributions distributed in accordance with this Agreement.
-  
-  "Recipient" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement,
-  including all Contributors.
-  
-  2. GRANT OF RIGHTS
-  
-  a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants
-  Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to
-  reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform,
-  distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, and such
-  derivative works, in source code and object code form.
-  
-  b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants
-  Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under Licensed
-  Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise transfer the
-  Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in source code and object code form.
-  This patent license shall apply to the combination of the Contribution and the
-  Program if, at the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such
-  addition of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the
-  Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other combinations
-  which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is licensed hereunder.
-  
-  c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the licenses to
-  its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are provided by any
-  Contributor that the Program does not infringe the patent or other intellectual
-  property rights of any other entity. Each Contributor disclaims any liability to
-  Recipient for claims brought by any other entity based on infringement of
-  intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the
-  rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole
-  responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any.
-  For example, if a third party patent license is required to allow Recipient to
-  distribute the Program, it is Recipient’s responsibility to acquire that license
-  before distributing the Program.
-  
-  d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient copyright
-  rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright license set forth in
-  this Agreement.
-  
-  3. REQUIREMENTS
-  
-  A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form under its
-  own license agreement, provided that:
-  
-  a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and
-  
-  b) its license agreement:
-  
-  i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties and
-  conditions, express and implied, including warranties or conditions of title and
-  non-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and
-  fitness for a particular purpose;
-  
-  ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability for
-  damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and consequential
-  damages, such as lost profits;
-  
-  iii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are offered by
-  that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and
-  
-  iv) states that source code for the Program is available from such Contributor,
-  and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable manner on or through a
-  medium customarily used for software exchange.
-  
-  When the Program is made available in source code form:
-  
-  a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and
-  b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the Program.
-  
-  Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained within the
-  Program.
-  
-  Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its Contribution, if
-  any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent Recipients to identify the
-  originator of the Contribution.
-  
-  4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION
-  
-  Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with
-  respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this license is
-  intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the Contributor who
-  includes the Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a manner
-  which does not create potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if
-  a Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering, such
-  Contributor ("Commercial Contributor") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify
-  every other Contributor ("Indemnified Contributor") against any losses, damages
-  and costs (collectively "Losses") arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal
-  actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified Contributor to the
-  extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in
-  connection with its distribution of the Program in a commercial product
-  offering. The obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses
-  relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement. In order
-  to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial
-  Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to
-  control, and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any
-  related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in
-  any such claim at its own expense.
-  
-  For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial product
-  offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor. If that
-  Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, or offers warranties
-  related to Product X, those performance claims and warranties are such
-  Commercial Contributor’s responsibility alone. Under this section, the
-  Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims against the other
-  Contributors related to those performance claims and warranties, and if a court
-  requires any other Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial
-  Contributor must pay those damages.
-  
-  5. NO WARRANTY
-  
-  EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN
-  "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR
-  IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE,
-  NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each
-  Recipient is solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using and
-  distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with its exercise of
-  rights under this Agreement , including but not limited to the risks and costs
-  of program errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data,
-  programs or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.
-  
-  6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY
-  
-  EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY
-  CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL,
-  SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST
-  PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT,
-  STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY
-  OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS
-  GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
-  
-  7. GENERAL
-  
-  If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under applicable
-  law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the
-  terms of this Agreement, and without further action by the parties hereto, such
-  provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such
-  provision valid and enforceable.
-  
-  If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity (including a
-  cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program itself
-  (excluding combinations of the Program with other software or hardware)
-  infringes such Recipient’s patent(s), then such Recipient’s rights granted under
-  Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.
-  
-  All Recipient’s rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails to
-  comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement and does
-  not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after becoming aware of
-  such noncompliance. If all Recipient’s rights under this Agreement terminate,
-  Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the Program as soon as
-  reasonably practicable. However, Recipient’s obligations under this Agreement
-  and any licenses granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and
-  survive.
-  
-  Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement, but in
-  order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and may only be
-  modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward reserves the right to
-  publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement from time to time.
-  No one other than the Agreement Steward has the right to modify this Agreement.
-  The Eclipse Foundation is the initial Agreement Steward. The Eclipse Foundation
-  may assign the responsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable
-  separate entity. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a
-  distinguishing version number. The Program (including Contributions) may always
-  be distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which it was
-  received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is published,
-  Contributor may elect to distribute the Program (including its Contributions)
-  under the new version. Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b)
-  above, Recipient receives no rights or licenses to the intellectual property of
-  any Contributor under this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication,
-  estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly granted under
-  this Agreement are reserved.
-  
-  This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and the
-  intellectual property laws of the United States of America. No party to this
-  Agreement will bring a legal action under this Agreement more than one year
-  after the cause of action arose. Each party waives its rights to a jury trial in
-  any resulting litigation.

-   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION
-
-   1. Definitions.
-
-      "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
-      and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.
-
-      "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
-      the copyright owner that is granting the License.
-
-      "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
-      other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
-      control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
-      "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
-      direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
-      otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
-      outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.
-
-      "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
-      exercising permissions granted by this License.
-
-      "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
-      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
-      source, and configuration files.
-
-      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
-      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
-      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
-      and conversions to other media types.
-
-      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
-      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
-      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
-      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
-
-      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
-      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
-      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
-      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
-      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
-      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
-      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
-
-      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
-      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
-      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
-      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
-      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
-      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
-      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
-      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
-      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
-      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
-      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
-      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
-      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
-
-      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
-      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
-      subsequently incorporated within the Work.
-
-   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
-      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
-      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
-      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
-      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
-      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
-
-   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
-      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
-      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
-      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
-      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
-      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
-      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
-      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
-      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
-      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
-      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
-      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
-      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
-      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
-      as of the date such litigation is filed.
-
-   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
-      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
-      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
-      meet the following conditions:
-
-      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
-          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
-
-      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
-          stating that You changed the files; and
-
-      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
-          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
-          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
-          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
-          the Derivative Works; and
-
-      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
-          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
-          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
-          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
-          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
-          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
-          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
-          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
-          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
-          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
-          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
-          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
-          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
-          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
-          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
-          as modifying the License.
-
-      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
-      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
-      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
-      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
-      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
-      the conditions stated in this License.
-
-   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
-      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
-      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
-      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
-      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
-      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
-      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
-
-   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
-      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
-      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
-      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
-
-   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
-      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
-      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
-      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
-      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
-      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
-      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
-      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
-      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
-
-   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
-      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
-      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
-      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
-      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
-      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
-      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
-      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
-      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
-      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
-      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
-
-   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
-      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
-      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
-      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
-      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
-      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
-      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
-      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
-      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
-      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
-
-   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

-  Eclipse Public License - v 1.0
-
-  THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS ECLIPSE
-  PUBLIC LICENSE ("AGREEMENT"). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION
-  OF THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.
-
-  1. DEFINITIONS
-
-  "Contribution" means:
-
-      a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial code and
-         documentation distributed under this Agreement, and
-
-      b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:
-
-          i) changes to the Program, and
-
-          ii) additions to the Program;
-              where such changes and/or additions to the Program
-              originate from and are distributed by that particular
-              Contributor. A Contribution 'originates' from a
-              Contributor if it was added to the Program by such
-              Contributor itself or anyone acting on such
-              Contributor's behalf. Contributions do not include
-              additions to the Program which: (i) are separate modules
-              of software distributed in conjunction with the Program
-              under their own license agreement, and (ii) are not
-              derivative works of the Program.
-
-  "Contributor" means any person or entity that distributes the Program.
-
-  "Licensed Patents" mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor
-  which are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its
-  Contribution alone or when combined with the Program.
-
-  "Program" means the Contributions distributed in accordance with
-  this Agreement.
-
-  "Recipient" means anyone who receives the Program under this
-  Agreement, including all Contributors.
-
-  2. GRANT OF RIGHTS
-
-      a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor
-         hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide,
-         royalty-free copyright license to reproduce, prepare
-         derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform,
-         distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such
-         Contributor, if any, and such derivative works, in source
-         code and object code form.
-
-      b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor
-         hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide,
-         royalty-free patent license under Licensed Patents to make,
-         use, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise transfer the
-         Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in source code and
-         object code form. This patent license shall apply to the
-         combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at the
-         time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such
-         addition of the Contribution causes such combination to be
-         covered by the Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not
-         apply to any other combinations which include the
-         Contribution. No hardware per se is licensed hereunder.
-
-      c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants
-         the licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no
-         assurances are provided by any Contributor that the Program
-         does not infringe the patent or other intellectual property
-         rights of any other entity. Each Contributor disclaims any
-         liability to Recipient for claims brought by any other entity
-         based on infringement of intellectual property rights or
-         otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and
-         licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes
-         sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual property
-         rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party patent
-         license is required to allow Recipient to distribute the
-         Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that
-         license before distributing the Program.
-
-      d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has
-         sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to
-         grant the copyright license set forth in this Agreement.
-
-  3. REQUIREMENTS
-
-  A Contributor  may choose to  distribute the Program in  object code
-  form under its own license agreement, provided that:
-
-      a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and
-
-      b) its license agreement:
-
-          i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all
-             warranties and conditions, express and implied, including
-             warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement,
-             and implied warranties or conditions of merchantability
-             and fitness for a particular purpose;
-
-          ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all
-              liability for damages, including direct, indirect,
-              special, incidental and consequential damages, such as
-              lost profits;
-
-          iii) states that any provisions which differ from this
-               Agreement are offered by that Contributor alone and not
-               by any other party; and
-
-          iv) states that source code for the Program is available
-              from such Contributor, and informs licensees how to
-              obtain it in a reasonable manner on or through a medium
-              customarily used for software exchange.
-
-  When the Program is made available in source code form:
-
-      a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and
-
-      b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of
-         the Program.
-
-  Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained
-  within the Program.
-
-  Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its
-  Contribution, if any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent
-  Recipients to identify the originator of the Contribution.
-
-  4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION
-
-  Commercial distributors of software may accept certain
-  responsibilities with respect to end users, business partners and
-  the like. While this license is intended to facilitate the
-  commercial use of the Program, the Contributor who includes the
-  Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a manner
-  which does not create potential liability for other Contributors.
-  Therefore, if a Contributor includes the Program in a commercial
-  product offering, such Contributor ("Commercial Contributor") hereby
-  agrees to defend and indemnify every other Contributor ("Indemnified
-  Contributor") against any losses, damages and costs (collectively
-  "Losses") arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal actions
-  brought by a third party against the Indemnified Contributor to the
-  extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial
-  Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program in a
-  commercial product offering. The obligations in this section do not
-  apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged
-  intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an
-  Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial
-  Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial
-  Contributor to control, and cooperate with the Commercial
-  Contributor in, the defense and any related settlement negotiations.
-  The Indemnified Contributor may participate in any such claim at its
-  own expense.
-
-  For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial
-  product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial
-  Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance
-  claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance
-  claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's
-  responsibility alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor
-  would have to defend claims against the other Contributors related
-  to those performance claims and warranties, and if a court requires
-  any other Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial
-  Contributor must pay those damages.
-
-  5. NO WARRANTY
-
-  EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS
-  PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF
-  ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION,
-  ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT,
-  MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient
-  is solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using
-  and distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with
-  its exercise of rights under this Agreement , including but not
-  limited to the risks and costs of program errors, compliance with
-  applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs or equipment,
-  and unavailability or interruption of operations.
-
-  6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY
-
-  EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT
-  NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT,
-  INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES
-  (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON
-  ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR
-  TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF
-  THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS
-  GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
-  DAMAGES.
-
-  7. GENERAL
-
-  If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under
-  applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability
-  of the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further
-  action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to
-  the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and
-  enforceable.
-
-  If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity
-  (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that
-  the Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other
-  software or hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then
-  such Recipient's rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate
-  as of the date such litigation is filed.
-
-  All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it
-  fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this
-  Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of
-  time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's
-  rights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use
-  and distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable.
-  However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement and any
-  licenses granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue
-  and survive.
-
-  Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this
-  Agreement, but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is
-  copyrighted and may only be modified in the following manner. The
-  Agreement Steward reserves the right to publish new versions
-  (including revisions) of this Agreement from time to time. No one
-  other than the Agreement Steward has the right to modify this
-  Agreement. The Eclipse Foundation is the initial Agreement Steward.
-  The Eclipse Foundation may assign the responsibility to serve as the
-  Agreement Steward to a suitable separate entity. Each new version of
-  the Agreement will be given a distinguishing version number. The
-  Program (including Contributions) may always be distributed subject
-  to the version of the Agreement under which it was received. In
-  addition, after a new version of the Agreement is published,
-  Contributor may elect to distribute the Program (including its
-  Contributions) under the new version. Except as expressly stated in
-  Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no rights or
-  licenses to the intellectual property of any Contributor under this
-  Agreement, whether expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise.
-  All rights in the Program not expressly granted under this Agreement
-  are reserved.
-
-  This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and
-  the intellectual property laws of the United States of America. No
-  party to this Agreement will bring a legal action under this
-  Agreement more than one year after the cause of action arose. Each
-  party waives its rights to a jury trial in any resulting litigation.

-  THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS COMMON
-  PUBLIC LICENSE ("AGREEMENT"). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF
-  THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.
-
-  1. DEFINITIONS
-
-  "Contribution" means:
-
-  a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial code and
-    documentation distributed under this Agreement, and
-
-  b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:
-
-  i) changes to the Program, and
-
-  ii) additions to the Program;
-
-  where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate
-  from and are distributed by that particular Contributor. A
-  Contribution 'originates' from a Contributor if it was added to the
-  Program by such Contributor itself or anyone acting on such
-  Contributor's behalf. Contributions do not include additions to the
-  Program which: (i) are separate modules of software distributed in
-  conjunction with the Program under their own license agreement,
-  and (ii) are not derivative works of the Program.
-
-  "Contributor" means any person or entity that distributes the Program.
-
-  "Licensed Patents " mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor
-  which are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution
-  alone or when combined with the Program.
-
-  "Program" means the Contributions distributed in accordance with this Agreement.
-
-  "Recipient" means anyone who receives the Program under this
-  Agreement, including all Contributors.
-
-  2. GRANT OF RIGHTS
-
-  a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor
-  hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free
-  copyright license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly
-  display, publicly perform, distribute and sublicense the Contribution
-  of such Contributor, if any, and such derivative works, in source code
-  and object code form.
-
-  b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor
-  hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free
-  patent license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to
-  sell, import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such
-  Contributor, if any, in source code and object code form. This patent
-  license shall apply to the combination of the Contribution and the
-  Program if, at the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor,
-  such addition of the Contribution causes such combination to be
-  covered by the Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to
-  any other combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per
-  se is licensed hereunder.
-
-  c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants
-  the licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are
-  provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the
-  patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity. Each
-  Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims brought by
-  any other entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights
-  or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses
-  granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility
-  to secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any. For
-  example, if a third party patent license is required to allow
-  Recipient to distribute the Program, it is Recipient's responsibility
-  to acquire that license before distributing the Program.
-
-  d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has
-  sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the
-  copyright license set forth in this Agreement.
-
-  3. REQUIREMENTS
-
-  A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form
-  under its own license agreement, provided that:
-
-  a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement;
-    and
-
-  b) its license agreement:
-
-  i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all
-  warranties and conditions, express and implied, including warranties
-  or conditions of title and non-infringement, and implied warranties or
-  conditions of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose;
-
-  ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all
-  liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental
-  and consequential damages, such as lost profits;
-
-  iii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement
-  are offered by that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and
-
-  iv) states that source code for the Program is available from
-  such Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a
-  reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily used for software
-  exchange.
-
-  When the Program is made available in source code form:
-
-  a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and 
-
-  b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of
-  the Program.
-
-  Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained
-  within the Program.
-
-  Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its
-  Contribution, if any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent
-  Recipients to identify the originator of the Contribution.
-

-  against any losses, damages and costs (collectively "Losses") arising
-  from claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third party
-  against the Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the acts
-  or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in connection with its
-  distribution of the Program in a commercial product offering. The
-  obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses
-  relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property
-  infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a)
-  promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in writing of such claim,
-  and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control, and cooperate with

-
-  If Recipient institutes patent litigation against a Contributor with
-  respect to a patent applicable to software (including a cross-claim or
-  counterclaim in a lawsuit), then any patent licenses granted by that
-  Contributor to such Recipient under this Agreement shall terminate as
-  of the date such litigation is filed. In addition, if Recipient
-  institutes patent litigation against any entity (including a

-
-          GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
-             Version 2, June 1991
-
-   Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
-                         59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA
-   Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
-   of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
-
-            Preamble
-
-    The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
-  freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
-  License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
-  software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This
-  General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
-  Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
-  using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
-  the GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to
-  your programs, too.
-
-    When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
-  price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
-  have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
-  this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
-  if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
-  in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.
-
-    To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
-  anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
-  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
-  distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.
-
-    For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
-  gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
-  you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
-  source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
-  rights.
-
-    We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
-  (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
-  distribute and/or modify the software.
-
-    Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
-  that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
-  software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
-  want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
-  that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
-  authors' reputations.
-
-    Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
-  patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
-  program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
-  program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
-  patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.
-
-    The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
-  modification follow.
-
-          GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
-     TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
-
-    0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains
-  a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
-  under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below,
-  refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"
-  means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
-  that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
-  either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
-  language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
-  the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".
-
-  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
-  covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
-  running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
-  is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
-  Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).
-  Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.
-
-    1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
-  source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
-  conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
-  copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
-  notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
-  and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
-  along with the Program.
-
-  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
-  you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.
-
-    2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
-  of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
-  distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
-  above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
-
-      a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
-      stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
-
-      b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
-      whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
-      part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
-      parties under the terms of this License.
-
-      c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
-      when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
-      interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
-      announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
-      notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
-      a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
-      these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
-      License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
-      does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
-      the Program is not required to print an announcement.)
-
-  These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
-  identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
-  and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
-  themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
-  sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
-  distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
-  on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
-  this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
-  entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.
-
-  Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
-  your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
-  exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
-  collective works based on the Program.
-
-  In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
-  with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
-  a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
-  the scope of this License.
-
-    3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
-  under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
-  Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:
-
-      a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
-      source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
-      1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,
-
-      b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
-      years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
-      cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
-      machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
-      distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
-      customarily used for software interchange; or,
-
-      c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
-      to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
-      allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
-      received the program in object code or executable form with such
-      an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)
-
-  The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
-  making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source
-  code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
-  associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
-  control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a
-  special exception, the source code distributed need not include
-  anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
-  form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
-  operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
-  itself accompanies the executable.
-
-  If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
-  access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
-  access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
-  distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
-  compelled to copy the source along with the object code.
-
-    4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
-  except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
-  otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
-  void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
-  However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
-  this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
-  parties remain in full compliance.
-
-    5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
-  signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
-  distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are
-  prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
-  modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
-  Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
-  all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
-  the Program or works based on it.
-
-    6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
-  Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
-  original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
-  these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
-  restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
-  You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
-  this License.
-
-    7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
-  infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
-  conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
-  otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
-  excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
-  distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
-  License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
-  may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent
-  license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
-  all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
-  the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
-  refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.
-
-  If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
-  any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
-  apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
-  circumstances.
-
-  It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
-  patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
-  such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
-  integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
-  implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
-  generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
-  through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
-  system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
-  to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
-  impose that choice.
-
-  This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
-  be a consequence of the rest of this License.
-
-    8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
-  certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
-  original copyright holder who places the Program under this License
-  may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
-  those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
-  countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
-  the limitation as if written in the body of this License.
-
-    9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
-  of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
-  be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
-  address new problems or concerns.
-
-  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
-  specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
-  later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions
-  either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
-  Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of
-  this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
-  Foundation.
-
-    10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
-  programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author
-  to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free
-  Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
-  make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals
-  of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and
-  of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.
-
-            NO WARRANTY
-
-    11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
-  FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN
-  OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
-  PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
-  OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
-  MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS
-  TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
-  PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
-  REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
-
-    12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
-  WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
-  REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
-  INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
-  OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
-  TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY
-  YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
-  PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
-  POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
-
-           END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

-The complete text of the GNU Lesser General Public License 2.1 is as follows:
-
-        GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
-             Version 2.1, February 1999
-
-   Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
-       59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA
-   Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
-   of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
-
-  [This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL.  It also counts
-   as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence
-   the version number 2.1.]
-
-            Preamble
-
-    The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
-  freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
-  Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change
-  free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.
-
-    This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some
-  specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the
-  Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You
-  can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether
-  this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better
-  strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.
-
-    When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,
-  not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that
-  you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge
-  for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get
-  it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of
-  it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do
-  these things.
-
-    To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
-  distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these
-  rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for
-  you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.
-
-    For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis
-  or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave
-  you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source
-  code.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide
-  complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them
-  with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling
-  it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.
-
-    We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the
-  library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal
-  permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.
-
-    To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that
-  there is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is
-  modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know
-  that what they have is not the original version, so that the original
-  author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be
-  introduced by others.
-
-    Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of
-  any free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot
-  effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a
-  restrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that
-  any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be
-  consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.
-
-    Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the
-  ordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser
-  General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and
-  is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use
-  this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those
-  libraries into non-free programs.
-
-    When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using
-  a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a
-  combined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary
-  General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the
-  entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General
-  Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with
-  the library.
-
-    We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it
-  does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General
-  Public License.  It also provides other free software developers Less
-  of an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages
-  are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many
-  libraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain
-  special circumstances.
-
-    For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to
-  encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes
-  a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must be
-  allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free
-  library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this
-  case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free
-  software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.
-
-    In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free
-  programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of
-  free software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in
-  non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU
-  operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating
-  system.
-
-    Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the
-  users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is
-  linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run
-  that program using a modified version of the Library.
-
-    The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
-  modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a
-  "work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library".  The
-  former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must
-  be combined with the library in order to run.
-
-        GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
-     TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
-
-    0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other
-  program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or
-  other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of
-  this Lesser General Public License (also called "this License").
-  Each licensee is addressed as "you".
-
-    A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data
-  prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs
-  (which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.
-
-    The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work
-  which has been distributed under these terms.  A "work based on the
-  Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under
-  copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a
-  portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated
-  straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is
-  included without limitation in the term "modification".)
-
-    "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for
-  making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means
-  all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated
-  interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation
-  and installation of the library.
-
-    Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
-  covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
-  running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from
-  such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based
-  on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for
-  writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does
-  and what the program that uses the Library does.
-  
-    1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's
-  complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that
-  you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an
-  appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact
-  all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any
-  warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the
-  Library.
-
-    You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,
-  and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a
-  fee.
-
-    2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion
-  of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and
-  distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
-  above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
-
-      a) The modified work must itself be a software library.
-
-      b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices
-      stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
-
-      c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no
-      charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.
-
-      d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a
-      table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses
-      the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility
-      is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,
-      in the event an application does not supply such function or
-      table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of
-      its purpose remains meaningful.
-
-      (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has
-      a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the
-      application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any
-      application-supplied function or table used by this function must
-      be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square
-      root function must still compute square roots.)
-
-  These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
-  identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,
-  and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
-  themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
-  sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
-  distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
-  on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
-  this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
-  entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote
-  it.
-
-  Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
-  your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
-  exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
-  collective works based on the Library.
-
-  In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library
-  with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of
-  a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
-  the scope of this License.
-
-    3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public
-  License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do
-  this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so
-  that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,
-  instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the
-  ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify
-  that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in
-  these notices.
-
-    Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for
-  that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all
-  subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.
-
-    This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of
-  the Library into a program that is not a library.
-
-    4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or
-  derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form
-  under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany
-  it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which
-  must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a
-  medium customarily used for software interchange.
-
-    If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy
-  from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the
-  source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to
-  distribute the source code, even though third parties are not
-  compelled to copy the source along with the object code.
-
-    5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the
-  Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or
-  linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library".  Such a
-  work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and
-  therefore falls outside the scope of this License.
-
-    However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library
-  creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it
-  contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the
-  library".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.
-  Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.
-
-    When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file
-  that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a
-  derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.
-  Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be
-  linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The
-  threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.
-
-    If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data
-  structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline
-  functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object
-  file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative
-  work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the
-  Library will still fall under Section 6.)
-
-    Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may
-  distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.
-  Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,
-  whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.
-
-    6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or
-  link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a
-  work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work
-  under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit
-  modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse
-  engineering for debugging such modifications.
-
-    You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the
-  Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by
-  this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work
-  during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the
-  copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference
-  directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one
-  of these things:
-
-      a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding
-      machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever
-      changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under
-      Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked
-      with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that
-      uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the
-      user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified
-      executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood
-      that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the
-      Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application
-      to use the modified definitions.)
-
-      b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the
-      Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a
-      copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,
-      rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)
-      will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if
-      the user installs one, as long as the modified version is
-      interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.
-
-      c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at
-      least three years, to give the same user the materials
-      specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more
-      than the cost of performing this distribution.
-
-      d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy
-      from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above
-      specified materials from the same place.
-
-      e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these
-      materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.
-
-    For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the
-  Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for
-  reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,
-  the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is
-  normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
-  components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
-  which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies
-  the executable.
-
-    It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license
-  restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally
-  accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot
-  use both them and the Library together in an executable that you
-  distribute.
-
-    7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
-  Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library
-  facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined
-  library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on
-  the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise
-  permitted, and provided that you do these two things:
-
-      a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work
-      based on the Library, uncombined with any other library
-      facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the
-      Sections above.
-
-      b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact
-      that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining
-      where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.
-
-    8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute
-  the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any
-  attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or
-  distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your
-  rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,
-  or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses
-  terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.
-
-    9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
-  signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
-  distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are
-  prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
-  modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the
-  Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
-  all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
-  the Library or works based on it.
-
-    10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the
-  Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
-  original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library
-  subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
-  restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
-  You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with
-  this License.
-
-    11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
-  infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
-  conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
-  otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
-  excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
-  distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
-  License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
-  may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent
-  license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by
-  all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
-  the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
-  refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.
-
-  If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
-  particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,
-  and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.
-
-  It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
-  patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
-  such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
-  integrity of the free software distribution system which is
-  implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
-  generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
-  through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
-  system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
-  to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
-  impose that choice.
-
-  This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
-  be a consequence of the rest of this License.
-
-    12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in
-  certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
-  original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add
-  an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,
-  so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus
-  excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if
-  written in the body of this License.
-
-    13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
-  versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.
-  Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,
-  but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
-
-  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library
-  specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and
-  "any later version", you have the option of following the terms and
-  conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
-  the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a
-  license version number, you may choose any version ever published by
-  the Free Software Foundation.
-
-    14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free
-  programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,
-  write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is
-  copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free
-  Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our
-  decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status
-  of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing
-  and reuse of software generally.
-
-            NO WARRANTY
-
-    15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
-  WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
-  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
-  OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY
-  KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE
-  IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
-  PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE
-  LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME
-  THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
-
-    16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
-  WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
-  AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU
-  FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR
-  CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE
-  LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING
-  RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A
-  FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF
-  SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
-  DAMAGES.
-
-           END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
-
-             How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries
-
-    If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest
-  possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that
-  everyone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting
-  redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the
-  ordinary General Public License).
-
-    To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.  It is
-  safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
-  convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
-  "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
-
-      <one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
-      Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>
-
-      This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or
-      modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public
-      License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either
-      version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.
-
-      This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
-      but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
-      MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU
-      Lesser General Public License for more details.
-
-      You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public
-      License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software
-      Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA
-
-  Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
-
-  You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
-  school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the library, if
-  necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:
-
-    Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the

-
-* GNU General Public License version 3
-* Apache 2.0 License
-* BSD License
-* Apache Software License Version 1.1
-* MIT License
-
-The complete text of the GNU General Public License version 3 is as follows:
-
-          GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
-             Version 3, 29 June 2007
-
-   Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>
-   Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
-   of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
-
-            Preamble
-
-    The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
-  software and other kinds of works.
-
-    The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed
-  to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,
-  the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to
-  share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free
-  software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the
-  GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to
-  any other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to
-  your programs, too.
-
-    When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
-  price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
-  have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
-  them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
-  want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
-  free programs, and that you know you can do these things.
-
-    To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you
-  these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have
-  certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if
-  you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.
-
-    For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
-  gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same
-  freedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive
-  or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they
-  know their rights.
-
-    Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:
-  (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License
-  giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.
-
-    For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains
-  that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and
-  authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as
-  changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to
-  authors of previous versions.
-
-    Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run
-  modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer
-  can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of
-  protecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic
-  pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to
-  use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we
-  have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those
-  products.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we
-  stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions
-  of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.
-
-    Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.
-  States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of
-  software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to
-  avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could
-  make it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that
-  patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.
-
-    The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
-  modification follow.
-
-             TERMS AND CONDITIONS
-
-    0. Definitions.
-
-    "This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.
-
-    "Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of
-  works, such as semiconductor masks.
- 
-    "The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this
-  License.  Each licensee is addressed as "you".  "Licensees" and
-  "recipients" may be individuals or organizations.
-
-    To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work
-  in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an
-  exact copy.  The resulting work is called a "modified version" of the
-  earlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work.
-
-    A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based
-  on the Program.
-
-    To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without
-  permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for
-  infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a
-  computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,
-  distribution (with or without modification), making available to the
-  public, and in some countries other activities as well.
-
-    To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other
-  parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through
-  a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.
-
-    An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices"
-  to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible
-  feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)
-  tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the
-  extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the
-  work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If
-  the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a
-  menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.
-
-    1. Source Code.
-
-    The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work
-  for making modifications to it.  "Object code" means any non-source
-  form of a work.
-
-    A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an official
-  standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of
-  interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that
-  is widely used among developers working in that language.
-
-    The "System Libraries" of an executable work include anything, other
-  than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of
-  packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major
-  Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that
-  Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an
-  implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A
-  "Major Component", in this context, means a major essential component
-  (kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system
-  (if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to
-  produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.
-
-    The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all
-  the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable
-  work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to
-  control those activities.  However, it does not include the work's
-  System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free
-  programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but
-  which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source
-  includes interface definition files associated with source files for
-  the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically
-  linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,
-  such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those
-  subprograms and other parts of the work.
-
-    The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users
-  can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding
-  Source.
-
-    The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that
-  same work.
-
-    2. Basic Permissions.
-
-    All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of
-  copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated
-  conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited
-  permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a
-  covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its
-  content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your
-  rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.
-
-    You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not
-  convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains
-  in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose
-  of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you
-  with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with
-  the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do
-  not control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works
-  for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction
-  and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of
-  your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.
-
-    Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under
-  the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10
-  makes it unnecessary.
-
-    3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.
-
-    No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological
-  measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article
-  11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or
-  similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such
-  measures.
-
-    When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid
-  circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention
-  is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to
-  the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or
-  modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's
-  users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of
-  technological measures.
-
-    4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.
-
-    You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you
-  receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
-  appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;
-  keep intact all notices stating that this License and any
-  non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;
-  keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all
-  recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.
-
-    You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,
-  and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.
-
-    5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.
-
-    You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to
-  produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the
-  terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
-
-      a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified
-      it, and giving a relevant date.
-
-      b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is
-      released under this License and any conditions added under section
-      7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to
-      "keep intact all notices".
-
-      c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this
-      License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This
-      License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7
-      additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,
-      regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no
-      permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not
-      invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.
-
-      d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display
-      Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive
-      interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your
-      work need not make them do so.
-
-    A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent
-  works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,
-  and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,
-  in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an
-  "aggregate" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not
-  used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users
-  beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work
-  in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other
-  parts of the aggregate.
-
-    6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.
-
-    You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms
-  of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the
-  machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,
-  in one of these ways:
-
-      a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
-      (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the
-      Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium
-      customarily used for software interchange.
-
-      b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
-      (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a
-      written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as
-      long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product
-      model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a
-      copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the
-      product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical
-      medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no
-      more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this
-      conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the
-      Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.
-
-      c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the
-      written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This
-      alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and
-      only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord
-      with subsection 6b.
-
-      d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated
-      place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the
-      Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no
-      further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the
-      Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to
-      copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source
-      may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)
-      that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain
-      clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the
-      Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the
-      Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is
-      available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.
-
-      e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided
-      you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding
-      Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no
-      charge under subsection 6d.
-
-    A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded
-  from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be
-  included in conveying the object code work.
-
-    A "User Product" is either (1) a "consumer product", which means any
-  tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,
-  or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation
-  into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,
-  doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular
-  product received by a particular user, "normally used" refers to a
-  typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status
-  of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user
-  actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product
-  is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial
-  commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent
-  the only significant mode of use of the product.
-
-    "Installation Information" for a User Product means any methods,
-  procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install
-  and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from
-  a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must
-  suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object
-  code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because
-  modification has been made.
-
-    If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or
-  specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as
-  part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the
-  User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a
-  fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the
-  Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied
-  by the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply
-  if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install
-  modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has
-  been installed in ROM).
-
-    The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a
-  requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates
-  for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for
-  the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a
-  network may be denied when the modification itself materially and
-  adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and
-  protocols for communication across the network.
-
-    Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,
-  in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly
-  documented (and with an implementation available to the public in
-  source code form), and must require no special password or key for
-  unpacking, reading or copying.
-
-    7. Additional Terms.
-
-    "Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of this
-  License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.
-  Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall
-  be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent
-  that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions
-  apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately
-  under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by
-  this License without regard to the additional permissions.
-
-    When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option
-  remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of
-  it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own
-  removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place
-  additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,
-  for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.
-
-    Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you
-  add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of
-  that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:
-
-      a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the
-      terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or
-
-      b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or
-      author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal
-      Notices displayed by works containing it; or
-
-      c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or
-      requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in
-      reasonable ways as different from the original version; or
-
-      d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or
-      authors of the material; or
-
-      e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some
-      trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or
-
-      f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that
-      material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of
-      it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for
-      any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on
-      those licensors and authors.
-
-    All other non-permissive additional terms are considered "further
-  restrictions" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you
-  received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is
-  governed by this License along with a term that is a further
-  restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains
-  a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this
-  License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms
-  of that license document, provided that the further restriction does
-  not survive such relicensing or conveying.
-
-    If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you
-  must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the
-  additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating
-  where to find the applicable terms.
-
-    Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the
-  form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;
-  the above requirements apply either way.
-
-    8. Termination.
-
-    You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly
-  provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or
-  modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under
-  this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third
-  paragraph of section 11).
-
-    However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your
-  license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
-  provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and
-  finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright
-  holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means
-  prior to 60 days after the cessation.
-
-    Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
-  reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
-  violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
-  received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that
-  copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after
-  your receipt of the notice.
-
-    Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the
-  licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under
-  this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently
-  reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same
-  material under section 10.
-
-    9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.
-
-    You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or
-  run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work
-  occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission
-  to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,
-  nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or
-  modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do
-  not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a
-  covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.
-
-    10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.
-
-    Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically
-  receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and
-  propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible
-  for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.
-
-    An "entity transaction" is a transaction transferring control of an
-  organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an
-  organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered
-  work results from an entity transaction, each party to that
-  transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever
-  licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could
-  give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the
-  Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if
-  the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.
-
-    You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the
-  rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may
-  not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of
-  rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation
-  (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that
-  any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for
-  sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.
-
-    11. Patents.
-
-    A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this
-  License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The
-  work thus licensed is called the contributor's "contributor version".
-
-    A contributor's "essential patent claims" are all patent claims
-  owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or
-  hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted
-  by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,
-  but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a
-  consequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For
-  purposes of this definition, "control" includes the right to grant
-  patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of
-  this License.
-
-    Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free
-  patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to
-  make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and
-  propagate the contents of its contributor version.
-
-    In the following three paragraphs, a "patent license" is any express
-  agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent
-  (such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to
-  sue for patent infringement).  To "grant" such a patent license to a
-  party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a
-  patent against the party.
-
-    If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,
-  and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone
-  to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a
-  publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,
-  then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so
-  available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the
-  patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner
-  consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent
-  license to downstream recipients.  "Knowingly relying" means you have
-  actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the
-  covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work
-  in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that
-  country that you have reason to believe are valid.
-  
-    If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or
-  arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a
-  covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties
-  receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify
-  or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license
-  you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered
-  work and works based on it.
-
-    A patent license is "discriminatory" if it does not include within
-  the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is
-  conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are
-  specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered
-  work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is
-  in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment
-  to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying
-  the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the
-  parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory
-  patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work
-  conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily
-  for and in connection with specific products or compilations that
-  contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,
-  or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.
-
-    Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting
-  any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may
-  otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.
-
-    12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.
-
-    If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
-  otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
-  excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a
-  covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
-  License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may
-  not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you
-  to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey
-  the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this
-  License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.
-
-    13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.
-
-    Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have
-  permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed
-  under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single
-  combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this
-  License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,
-  but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,
-  section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the
-  combination as such.
-
-    14. Revised Versions of this License.
-
-    The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of
-  the GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
-  be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
-  address new problems or concerns.
-
-    Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the
-  Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General
-  Public License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the
-  option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered
-  version or of any later version published by the Free Software
-  Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the
-  GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published
-  by the Free Software Foundation.
-
-    If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future
-  versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's
-  public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you
-  to choose that version for the Program.
-
-    Later license versions may give you additional or different
-  permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any
-  author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a
-  later version.
-
-    15. Disclaimer of Warranty.
-
-    THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY
-  APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT
-  HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY
-  OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,
-  THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
-  PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM
-  IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF
-  ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
-
-    16. Limitation of Liability.
-
-    IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
-  WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS
-  THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY
-  GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE
-  USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF
-  DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD
-  PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),
-  EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF
-  SUCH DAMAGES.
-
-    17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.
-
-    If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided
-  above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,
-  reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates
-  an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the
-  Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a
-  copy of the Program in return for a fee.
-
-           END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
-
-        How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
-
-    If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
-  possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
-  free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.
-
-    To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
-  to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
-  state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
-  the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
-
-      <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
-      Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>
-
-      This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify
-      it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
-      the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or
-      (at your option) any later version.
-
-      This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
-      but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
-      MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
-      GNU General Public License for more details.
-
-      You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
-      along with this program.  If not, see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.
-
-  Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
-
-    If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short
-  notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:
-
-      <program>  Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>
-      This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.
-      This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
-      under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.
-
-  The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate
-  parts of the General Public License.  Of course, your program's commands
-  might be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an "about box".
-
-    You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,
-  if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if necessary.
-  For more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see
-  <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.
-
-    The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program
-  into proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you
-  may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with
-  the library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General
-  Public License instead of this License.  But first, please read
-  <http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/why-not-lgpl.html>.

-     Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
-     copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
-     (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
-
-     "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
-     form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
-     editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
-     represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
-     of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
-     separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
-     the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
-
-     "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
-     the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
-     to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
-     submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
-     or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
-     the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
-     means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent

-     Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
-     excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
-     designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
-
-     "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
-     on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
-     subsequently incorporated within the Work.
-
-  2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
-     this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
-     worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
-     copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
-     publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
-     Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
-
-  3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
-     this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
-     worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
-     (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
-     use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
-     where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
-     by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
-     Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
-     with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
-     institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
-     cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
-     or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
-     or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
-     granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
-     as of the date such litigation is filed.
-
-  4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
-     Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
-     modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
-     meet the following conditions:
-
-     (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
-         Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
-
-     (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
-         stating that You changed the files; and
-
-     (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
-         that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
-         attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
-         excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
-         the Derivative Works; and
-
-     (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
-         distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
-         include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
-         within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
-         pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
-         of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
-         as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
-         documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
-         within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
-         wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
-         of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
-         do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
-         notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
-         or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
-         that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
-         as modifying the License.
-
-     You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
-     may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
-     for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
-     for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
-     reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
-     the conditions stated in this License.
-
-  5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
-     any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
-     by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
-     this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
-     Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
-     the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
-     with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
-
-  6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
-     names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
-     except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
-     origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
-
-  7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
-     agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
-     Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
-     WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
-     implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
-     of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
-     PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
-     appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
-     risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
-
-  8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
-     whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
-     unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
-     negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
-     liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
-     incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
-     result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
-     Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
-     work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
-     other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
-     has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
-
-  9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
-     the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
-     and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
-     or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
-     License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
-     on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
-     of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
-     defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
-     incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
-     of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
-

-
-The complete text of the Eclipse Public License v1.0 is as follows:
-
-  Eclipse Public License - v 1.0
-  
-  THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS ECLIPSE PUBLIC
-  LICENSE ("AGREEMENT"). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM
-  CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT’S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.
-  
-  1. DEFINITIONS
-  
-  "Contribution" means:
-  
-  a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial code and documentation
-  distributed under this Agreement, and
-  b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:
-  
-  i) changes to the Program, and
-  
-  ii) additions to the Program;
-  
-  where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from and are
-  distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution 'originates' from a
-  Contributor if it was added to the Program by such Contributor itself or anyone
-  acting on such Contributor’s behalf. Contributions do not include additions to
-  the Program which: (i) are separate modules of software distributed in
-  conjunction with the Program under their own license agreement, and (ii) are not
-  derivative works of the Program.
-  
-  "Contributor" means any person or entity that distributes the Program.
-  
-  "Licensed Patents " mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which are
-  necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone or when
-  combined with the Program.
-  
-  "Program" means the Contributions distributed in accordance with this Agreement.
-  
-  "Recipient" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement,
-  including all Contributors.
-  
-  2. GRANT OF RIGHTS
-  
-  a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants
-  Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to
-  reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform,
-  distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, and such
-  derivative works, in source code and object code form.
-  
-  b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants
-  Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under Licensed
-  Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise transfer the
-  Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in source code and object code form.
-  This patent license shall apply to the combination of the Contribution and the
-  Program if, at the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such
-  addition of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the
-  Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other combinations
-  which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is licensed hereunder.
-  
-  c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the licenses to
-  its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are provided by any
-  Contributor that the Program does not infringe the patent or other intellectual
-  property rights of any other entity. Each Contributor disclaims any liability to
-  Recipient for claims brought by any other entity based on infringement of
-  intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the
-  rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole
-  responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any.
-  For example, if a third party patent license is required to allow Recipient to
-  distribute the Program, it is Recipient’s responsibility to acquire that license
-  before distributing the Program.
-  
-  d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient copyright
-  rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright license set forth in
-  this Agreement.
-  
-  3. REQUIREMENTS
-  
-  A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form under its
-  own license agreement, provided that:
-  
-  a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and
-  
-  b) its license agreement:
-  
-  i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties and
-  conditions, express and implied, including warranties or conditions of title and
-  non-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and
-  fitness for a particular purpose;
-  
-  ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability for
-  damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and consequential
-  damages, such as lost profits;
-  
-  iii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are offered by
-  that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and
-  
-  iv) states that source code for the Program is available from such Contributor,
-  and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable manner on or through a
-  medium customarily used for software exchange.
-  
-  When the Program is made available in source code form:
-  
-  a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and
-  b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the Program.
-  
-  Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained within the
-  Program.
-  
-  Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its Contribution, if
-  any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent Recipients to identify the
-  originator of the Contribution.
-  
-  4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION
-  
-  Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with
-  respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this license is
-  intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the Contributor who
-  includes the Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a manner
-  which does not create potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if
-  a Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering, such
-  Contributor ("Commercial Contributor") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify
-  every other Contributor ("Indemnified Contributor") against any losses, damages
-  and costs (collectively "Losses") arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal
-  actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified Contributor to the
-  extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in
-  connection with its distribution of the Program in a commercial product
-  offering. The obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses
-  relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement. In order
-  to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial
-  Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to
-  control, and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any
-  related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in
-  any such claim at its own expense.
-  
-  For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial product
-  offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor. If that
-  Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, or offers warranties
-  related to Product X, those performance claims and warranties are such
-  Commercial Contributor’s responsibility alone. Under this section, the
-  Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims against the other
-  Contributors related to those performance claims and warranties, and if a court
-  requires any other Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial
-  Contributor must pay those damages.
-  
-  5. NO WARRANTY
-  
-  EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN
-  "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR
-  IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE,
-  NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each
-  Recipient is solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using and
-  distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with its exercise of
-  rights under this Agreement , including but not limited to the risks and costs
-  of program errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data,
-  programs or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.
-  
-  6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY
-  
-  EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY
-  CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL,
-  SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST
-  PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT,
-  STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY
-  OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS
-  GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
-  
-  7. GENERAL
-  
-  If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under applicable
-  law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the
-  terms of this Agreement, and without further action by the parties hereto, such
-  provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such
-  provision valid and enforceable.
-  
-  If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity (including a
-  cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program itself
-  (excluding combinations of the Program with other software or hardware)
-  infringes such Recipient’s patent(s), then such Recipient’s rights granted under
-  Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.
-  
-  All Recipient’s rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails to
-  comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement and does
-  not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after becoming aware of
-  such noncompliance. If all Recipient’s rights under this Agreement terminate,
-  Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the Program as soon as
-  reasonably practicable. However, Recipient’s obligations under this Agreement
-  and any licenses granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and
-  survive.
-  
-  Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement, but in
-  order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and may only be
-  modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward reserves the right to
-  publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement from time to time.
-  No one other than the Agreement Steward has the right to modify this Agreement.
-  The Eclipse Foundation is the initial Agreement Steward. The Eclipse Foundation
-  may assign the responsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable
-  separate entity. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a
-  distinguishing version number. The Program (including Contributions) may always
-  be distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which it was
-  received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is published,
-  Contributor may elect to distribute the Program (including its Contributions)
-  under the new version. Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b)
-  above, Recipient receives no rights or licenses to the intellectual property of
-  any Contributor under this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication,
-  estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly granted under
-  this Agreement are reserved.
-  
-  This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and the
-  intellectual property laws of the United States of America. No party to this
-  Agreement will bring a legal action under this Agreement more than one year
-  after the cause of action arose. Each party waives its rights to a jury trial in
-  any resulting litigation.

-   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION
-
-   1. Definitions.

-      "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
-      and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.
-
-      "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
-      the copyright owner that is granting the License.
-
-      "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
-      other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
-      control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
-      "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
-      direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
-      otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the

-
-      "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
-      exercising permissions granted by this License.
-
-      "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
-      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
-      source, and configuration files.
-
-      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
-      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
-      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
-      and conversions to other media types.
-
-      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
-      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
-      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
-      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
-
-      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
-      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
-      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
-      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
-      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
-      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
-      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
-
-      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
-      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
-      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
-      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
-      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
-      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
-      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
-      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
-      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
-      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
-      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
-      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
-      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
-
-      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
-      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
-      subsequently incorporated within the Work.
-
-   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
-      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
-      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
-      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
-      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
-      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
-
-   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
-      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
-      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
-      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
-      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
-      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
-      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
-      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
-      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
-      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
-      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
-      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
-      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
-      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
-      as of the date such litigation is filed.
-
-   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
-      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
-      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
-      meet the following conditions:
-
-      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
-          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
-
-      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
-          stating that You changed the files; and
-
-      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
-          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
-          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
-          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
-          the Derivative Works; and
-
-      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
-          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
-          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
-          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
-          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
-          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
-          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
-          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
-          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
-          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
-          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
-          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
-          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
-          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
-          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
-          as modifying the License.
-
-      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
-      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
-      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
-      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
-      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
-      the conditions stated in this License.
-
-   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
-      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
-      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
-      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
-      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
-      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
-      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
-
-   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
-      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
-      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
-      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
-
-   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
-      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
-      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
-      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
-      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
-      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
-      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
-      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
-      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
-
-   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
-      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
-      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
-      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
-      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
-      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
-      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
-      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
-      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
-      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
-      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
-
-   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
-      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
-      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
-      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
-      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
-      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
-      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
-      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
-      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
-      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
-
-   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
