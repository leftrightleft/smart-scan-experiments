+### Logstash Plugin Changelog Guidelines
+
+This document provides guidelines on editing a logstash plugin's CHANGELOG file.
+
+#### What's a CHANGELOG file?
+
+According to [keepachangelog.com](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/):
+
+> A changelog is a file which contains a curated, chronologically ordered list of notable changes for each version of a project.
+
+Each logstash plugin contains a CHANGELOG.md markdown file. Here's an example: https://github.com/logstash-plugins/logstash-input-file/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md
+
+#### How is the CHANGELOG.md populated?
+
+Updates are done manually, according to the following rules:
+
+#### When should I add an entry to the CHANGELOG.md?
+
+Update the changelog before you push a new release to rubygems.org.
+
+To prevent merged pull requests from sitting in the master branch until someone decides to cut a release,
+we strive to publish a new version for each pull request. (This is not mandatory. See below.)
+You are therefore encouraged to bump the gemspec version and add a changelog entry in the same pull request as the change. See [logstash-input-snmp#8](https://github.com/logstash-plugins/logstash-input-snmp/pull/8/files) as an example.
+
+If have no intentions to release the change immediately after merging the pull request
+then you should still create an entry in the changelog, using the word `Unreleased` as the version. Example:
+
+```markdown
+## Unreleased
+  - Removed `sleep(0.0001)` from inner loop that was making things a bit slower [#133](http://example.org)
+
+## 3.3.3
+  - Fix when no delimiter is found in a chunk, the chunk is reread - no forward progress
+    is made in the file [#185](http://example.org)
+```
+
+#### What is the format of the Changelog entries?
+
+Most code in logstash-plugins comes from self-contained changes in the form of pull requests, so each entry should:
+
+1. be a summary of the Pull Request and contain a markdown link to it.
+2. start with one of the following keys: `Added`, `Changed`, `Deprecated`, `Removed`, `Fixed`, `Security`
+3. keep multiple entries with the same keyword in the same changelog revision together
+
+The meaning of the keywords is as follows (copied from [keepachangelog.com](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/#how):
+
+- **`Added`** for new features.
+- **`Changed`** for changes in existing functionality.
+- **`Deprecated`** for soon-to-be removed features.
+- **`Removed`** for now removed features.
+- **`Fixed`** for any bug fixes.
+- **`Security`** in case of vulnerabilities.
+
+Example:
+
+```
+## 3.4.0
+- Changed default value of `number_of_threads` from 2 to 1 [#101](http://example.org)
+- Changed default value of `execution_bugs` from 30 to 0 [#104](http://example.org)
+- Removed obsolete option `enable_telnet` option [#100](http://example.org)
+
+## 3.3.2
+- Fixed incorrect serialization of input data when encoding was `Emacs-Mule` [#84](http://example.org)
+
+## 3.3.1
+- Fixed memory leak by removing calls to `leak_lots_of_memory` [#86](http://example.org)
+```
