 == Breaking Changes
 
-This section discusses the changes that you need to be aware of when migrating to Logstash 6.0.0 from the previous major releases.
+We strive to maintain backward compatibility between minor versions (6.x to 6.y,
+for example) so that you can upgrade without changing any configuration files.
+Breaking changes are usually introduced only between major versions (such as 5.x
+to 6.y). On occasion, we are forced to break compatibility within a given major release
+to ensure correctness of operation.
+
+This section covers the changes that you need to be aware of when migrating to
+Logstash 6.0.0 and later.

+NOTE: Migrating directly between non-consecutive major versions (1.x to
+6.x) is not recommended.
