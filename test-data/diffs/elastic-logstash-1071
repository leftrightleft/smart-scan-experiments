 == Storing logs with Elasticsearch 
 Now, you're probably saying, "that's all fine and dandy, but typing all my logs into logstash isn't really an option, and merely seeing them spit to STDOUT isn't very useful." Good point. First, let's set up Elasticsearch to store the messages we send into logstash. If you don't have Elasticearch already installed, you can http://www.elasticsearch.org/download/[download the RPM or DEB package], or install manually by downloading the current release tarball, by issuing the following four commands:

-NOTE: This tutorial specifies running Logstash 1.3.3 with Elasticsearch 0.90.10. Each release of Logstash has a *recommended* version of Elasticsearch to pair with. Make sure the versions match based on the http://logstash.net/docs/latest[Logstash version] you're running!

 More detailed information on installing and configuring Elasticsearch can be found on http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/index.html[The Elasticsearch reference pages]. However, for the purposes of Getting Started with Logstash, the default installation and configuration of Elasticsearch should be sufficient.
 
 Now that we have Elasticsearch running on port 9200 (we do, right?), logstash can be simply configured to use Elasticsearch as its backend. The defaults for both logstash and Elasticsearch are fairly sane and well thought out, so we can omit the optional configurations within the elasticsearch output:
 ----
-java -jar logstash-1.3.3-flatjar.jar agent -e 'input { stdin { } } output { elasticsearch { host => localhost } }'
+bin/logstash -e 'input { stdin { } } output { elasticsearch { host => localhost } }'

 Normally, a client machine would connect to the logstash instance on port 5000 and send its message.
